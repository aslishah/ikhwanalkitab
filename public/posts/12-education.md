# Medieval Muslim Education, Arabic Books, and the Formation of the Islamic World

## Objectives {-} 

This seminar builds on students’ knowledge of the political developments in the Islamic world, cities and provinces. We will discuss the origin, development and formalisation of educational practices in the medieval Islamic world and their long-lasting implications, especially for the formation of a 'Muslim world' as we know it today.

The main objective is to provide an introduction to pre-modern Islamicate learning practices and the scholarly elite. A set of primary and secondary readings are assigned to inform you of the main debates about the topic and to get an idea about what "pursuing knowledge" meant to different groups. We will read historical sources, examine manuscript evidence for fine details, and use digital tools to get a bird's-eye view of the Arabic written tradition.

## Medieval Muslims's view on teaching the Quran to their children {-}
___
``` 
Muslims throughout their history have diligently taught their children  the Qurʾān and provided 
them  with teachers. This is something that  no  father refrains from doing for  his child if he
has the means to do so, unless he is following his souls avarice. The latter is  no excuse for 
him  [...] Not one father would leave of doing this, deeming its omission trivial and 
insignificant  a coarse father with no desire for good.

Abuʾl Ḥasan al-Qābisī (d. 1012), jurist from Qayrawān,Tunisia,
al-Risāla al-mufaṣṣila li-aḥwāl al mutaʿallimīn  wa aḥkām al muʿallimīn waʾl-mutaʿallimīn, 
in Classical Foundations (tr. M. Fishbein, p. 46)


```
```
It should be known that instructing children in the Qurʾan is a symbol of Islam.  Muslims have, 
and  practice, such instruction in their cities...

Ibn Khaldūn (d. 1406), Maghribi jurist and historian from Tunis.

## Excercise 1. How long did it take to get to Mecca from Kabul, Cordova or Samarqand? {-} 

> In modern days, the journey from Kabul to Mecca could take about 7hrs, (Kabul-Jeddah flight takes 5.30h, Jeddah-Mecca drive take 1 hour. Using the **Path Finding** tool on Althurayya Website below, can you find the **shortest** and **most optimal** medieval route to travel from Kabul to Mecca. Would you chose a different route if you were a tenth-century pilgrim from Central Asia? How do you think modern means of communication and transportation may influence our views about the past? 

``` 
The settlements and routes below are based on medieval Arabic books of geography. 
Try to use enter the URI to measure the distance between various locations. For isntance
to find the distance between Samarqand and Damascus, you have to choose the "Path Finding" 
option (-> sign)on the left) the use Arabic names and URIs in "Source" and "Destination" 
to find the shortest and optimal path, distance, and duration of travel. 

NOTE: In order to create a route, you have to choose settlements (town URIs ending with "_S"
(e.g. SAMARQAND_670E396N_S) and not regions (regions URI ends with "_R", which stands for "Region").

## Excercise 2. "The Rise of the Arabic Book". Where did the early authors of Arabic books come from?  {-} 

> Use the application below to get quantitative insights into textual production in Arabic language, based on texts from the Open Islamicate Text Initiative Corpus (OpenITI) authored during the first five centuries of Islam (1-505 AH/622-1111). The books are grouped by their authors' place of birth, which gives you an idea about the spread of Arabic language and Islam over time. If you are not sure about the historical regions, you can use the Al-Thurayya tool in Exercise 1 to figure out. 

```
Tasks:

1) Navigate to Page 2 of the App, and use "filter by AD date" to find out which regions dominate
textual production. How accurate do you think this estimatation is? 

2) Navigate to Page 3 (Rise of Book) off the app, which shows the distribution of the corpus over
time and space. What are the most obvious trends? What factors led to this?

> Questions  for discussion: 

> * What role did knowledge networks and institutions of education play in the formation of the Muslim world as we know it today?
> * What about empires and states: What role did  patronage play in the development of Islamic educational institutions.
> * Was there a medieval "Muslim world" or the idea of the "Muslim world" is a hegemonic narrative to counter Western colonisation?
