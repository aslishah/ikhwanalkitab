### Lectures {.unnumbered}

Weekly lectures will cover the period from the rise of Islam in Late Antiquity to the decline of the major caliphates and the appearances of new polities ruled mostly by non-Arabs, culminating with the Mongol invasion of the Middle East by the end of the 1250s CE. Each lecture will highlight historiographical issues, which will then be picked up during the seminars.

### Seminars {.unnumbered}

Seminars will follow the themes of the lectures but will expect input from students. For this, in addition to the discussion of secondary sources, students will be expected to engage with short excerpts from primary sources listed in the syllabus. Presentations will also take place during the seminars.

To prepare for the seminars you must read the weekly readings listed first closely as these will provide you with the general framework. Reading these will help you to be more selective about books and articles recommended for further reading. The short primary source readings are also essential for the seminars. All of this will help you with the exams.

### Assessment {.unnumbered}

*Essay (50%), open-book exam (30%), presentation (15%), participation (5%).*

***Essay,*** of maximum 3000 words. Essay questions will be drawn from the lectures and seminars topics and will be given one week before the submission date. You will be expected to be able to connect several topics and draw upon readings from several weeks, in addition to topic specific readings which will be provided with the questions.

***Open-book exam.*** The questions for open-book exam will be based on the list of books provided in the end of this syllabus. You will be asked to answer one of the questions within three hours, drawing on your knowledge of the course materials. The response must demonstrate a good overall understanding of the topics of Islamic history, an ability to select relevant material, and a close engagement with the selected books that you will have access to during the exam.
