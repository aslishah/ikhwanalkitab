## Chapter 7. A Community of Jurists

Aslisho Qurboniev


When we saw historical traces being obliterated and history being wiped out, our thoughts were provoked to compose the history of the shaykhs who passed before us, the members of this daʿwa and the righteous amongst them, and to mention their good deeds, the uprightness of their character, the magnificence of their ways, and the extent of their virtues. To this end, we wrote down whatever we could, fearing that people may disregard it and consign it to oblivion. We plead with God and ask Him for protection and for His reward for our undertaking, for He is our benefactor. He is sufficient for us, and He is the best protector! 

Abū Zakariyāʾ al-Warjalānī (d. after 470/1078)


At the turn of the ninth century, two learned men entered Ifrīqiya (a province roughly corresponding to modern Tunisia) each carrying a compendium of Islamic law with him. One of them, Asad b. al-Furāt (d. 213/828), had grown up in Qayrawān and was now returning there after a three-year journey in pursuit of knowledge in Ḥijāz, ʿIrāq and Egypt.  His book was a compilation of legal opinions transmitted from Mālik b. Anas by his Egyptian student ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn al-Qāsim al-ʿUtaqī (d. 191/807), with whom Asad had studied in Egypt. He had also studied directly with Mālik b. Anas in Medina and with several students of Abū Ḥanīfa in ʿIrāq, thus connecting himself to the two most prominent jurists of the time. Asad b. al-Furāt’s compilation, known as Asadiyya, reportedly consisted of questions that originated in the Iraqi milieu for which Asad had sought Mālik’s answers. The compilation was not flawless and was criticised. Nevertheless, it gained him admiration among the legal scholars of Qayrawān until it was superseded by an updated version brought to Qayrawān around AD 804, by a local scholar, Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd, who allegedly went to the East to remedy the problems of the Asadiyya.  This story lays bare the nature of the competition between these two Ifrīqiyan jurists. According to the Mālikī sources, Saḥnūn obtained a full copy of the Asadiyya without Asad’s approval and took it to Egypt, where he read it with Ibn al-Qāsim and produced a revised version. To stop Asad from teaching his version, the story goes, Ibn al-Qāsim sent him an upsetting letter, but according to the Mālikī tradition, he accepted the authoritativeness of Saḥnūn’s rival compilation, now called the Mudawwana.  The Mudawwana subsequently became the most authoritative legal compendium for the Mālikī community of the Islamic West, and through its transmission by Saḥnūn’s students, it came to represent the crowning achievement of their teacher and their scholarly community whereas Asad  was remembered mainly as the conqueror of Sicily for the Aghlabids.
The second book was brought to Ifrīqiya by Abū Ghānim Bishr b. Ghānim al-Khurāsānī (d. early third/ninth century). It was also called Mudawwana, but it had nothing to do with the Mālikīs.  This book belonged to the Ibāḍī community, and it is considered ‘the oldest Ibāḍī treatise on general jurisprudence’, based on the teachings of the Basran Ibāḍī scholar Abū ʿUbayda Muslim al-Tamīmī (d. circa 136–58/754–75).  Abū ʿUbayda was recognised as an Ibāḍī imam and is known for organising and dispatching Ibāḍī missionaries, called ḥamalat al-ʿilm (bearers of knowledge).  One of the first missionaries sent by Abū ʿUbayda, Abū al-Khaṭṭāb al-Maʿāfirī, managed to capture Tripoli and, briefly, even Qayrawān, where he appointed ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Rustam the future founder of the Rustamid state of Tahert (r. 161–71/778–88), as the governor.  Abū Ghānim, who belonged to another generation of the ḥamalat al-ʿilm, was travelling to Tahert to visit the second Rustamid imam, ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān (r. 171–208/788–824). The Ibāḍī tradition preserves an interesting memory of Abū Ghānim’s passing by Jabal Nafūsa, the Ibāḍī stronghold in Ifrīqiya, which highlights the importance of his Mudawwana for the survival of the community:
When Abū Ghānim Bishr b. Ghānim al-Khurāsānī travelled from the Mashriq to the Maghrib for an audience with the [Rustamid] imam ʿAbd al-Wahhāb [168–208/784–823] – may God be pleased with him – he brought his famous Mudawwana with him. He transmitted it from the students of Abū ʿUbayda – may God be pleased with him – and had fixed the transmission in writing. On the way to Tahert, [Abū Ghānim] passed through Jabal Nafūsa, where he lent the abovementioned book to the young ʿAmrūs but declined [the latter’s] request to copy it. So ʿAmrūs contemplated copying the book [without permission] and eventually gave in to his desire for knowledge, so he devoted himself to the task of copying the book while his sister dictated to him.  He would [copy] the book until the sun reached him. Then he would move to sit in the shade for copying, with the original copy still in his sister’s hands but his eyes fixated on the writing because of his extreme passion for the revival of knowledge (ʿilm). By the time Abū Ghānim returned from Tahert, ʿAmrūs had completed the copying. Then he put [the book] back where it had been. When the owner retrieved the [original] book, he saw an ink dot on a part of it and asked him: ‘Did you steal this?’ He [ʿAmrūs] replied: ‘Yes; call me a knowledge thief, by transmitting not by stealing? (akhbāran lā amran).’ This book consisted of twelve parts. Afterwards, the treasury of Tahert was burnt and plundered [by the Fāṭimids]. Were it not for ʿAmrūs’s holding on to this book, the community (ahl al-madhhab) in the lands of the Maghrib would have had no collection (dīwān) to rely on. This was made possible [only] through ʿAmrūs’s good will, blessing and good fortune. 
The foundational stories of Asad b. al-Furāt and Abū Ghānim reveal the importance of the written word as the cornerstone of communal memory and identity both for the urban Arabic-speaking Mālikīs and the Berber-speaking Ibāḍīs of rural Ifrīqiya. The rise of the Shīʿī Fāṭimids in the tenth century put an end to the Ibāḍī state of Tahert and led to the suppression of several major Ibāḍī uprisings in the mountains. The Mālikī scholars of Qayrawān, although largely left to their own devices, also saw the Fāṭimid rule as a threat to their community. Deprived of state patronage, both communities had to rely on strategies of their own to maintain their communal identities and boundaries.  Thus, they often saw their memory practices, as expressed in the quotation from Abū Zakariyyā al-Warjalānī that opens this chapter, as a struggle against oblivion.
In this chapter I explore the mechanisms, instruments and above all incentives that maintained these communities. I ask: what sustained the sociocultural and ideological continuity that was vital to their survival as distinct communities? Answering this question will hopefully provide fresh insights into the cultural memory of Muslims and of the numerous subgroups that produced the textual heritage of Islam. In particular, the chapter will illustrate the interdependence of texts, narratives and memory in the formation of the most important community of religious scholars in the Islamic West, the Mālikīs. 
Scholarly communities, especially the early Mālikīs of the Islamic West, have been studied on the bases of their textual output, but memory processes have rarely been considered in the formation of the tradition. This perspective helps bring out the social function of memory practices and the contexts that made these practices significant to the Mālikī community. Evidence of text reuse adds further insight into the process through which the cultural memory of the Islamic West was formed and in which the Mālikī jurists played a prominent role. Reuse data shows how texts (both legal texts and biographies) were accumulated over time into massive compilations, and in the case of legal texts were later condensed into shorter but much more practical abridgements (mukhtaṣar, ikhtiṣār, etc.), which again invited participation through commentary and elaboration from the scholarly community (Figures 1 and 4).

The Mālikī Community of Qayrawān and Their Remembrance of the Past

In the medieval Islamic world, religion and ethnic affiliations were both strong markers of community, while ethnic or tribal belongings often intersected with religious proclivities.  The rural medieval Maghrib with its predominantly Berber population provides an interesting case of the interplay between tribal and religious affiliations,  which contrasted with the urban centres occupied predominantly by Arabs and other Arabised Muslims. For the latter, at least for the educated elite, the biographical collections inform us, religious belonging increasingly played a more prominent role as a marker of community than did tribal and regional ties. To put it differently, ethnic origin was not a barrier to membership in a community defined by its doctrinal position, such as the Mālikī community. On the other hand, identification with geographies and space also often intersected with a school of interpretation, for which the Medinian and Kūfans/ʿIrāqīs of Qayrawān are our most fitting examples. These two groups initially associated with the region where their major authorities resided later became known as Mālikī and Ḥanafī respectively? Thus, for the cosmopolitan and literate societies of the Islamic world, a new type of belonging to a community defined by its legal and doctrinal positions and sometimes by mutually exclusive interpretations of religion, became more important.  The madhhab, even in the loosest sense of the word, became the main form of affiliation, networking and knowledge transmission, and subsequently a  framework  for imagining the community and its continuity and coherence in the past. As I will argue below, texts and textual networks constituted crucial instruments for the legitimation, preservation and promotion of these scholarly communities through the shaping and reshaping of their pasts. 
The case study for this chapter is the text-centred memory practices of legal scholars of Ifrīqiya that led to the consolidation of the Mālikī community. The legal teachings of Mālik b. Anas (d. 179/795) were transmitted by his students to the scholars of the Islamic West shortly after his death, but the need to preserve the link with Mālik seem to have become more pressing in later periods.  These activities led to the rise and dominance of a religious orientation and a scholarly culture in the Islamic West, especially Qayrawān and Cordoba, that coalesced around the legal opinions of Mālik.  A unique collection of texts from the mosque library of Qayrawān that survive from this period shows that networks of textual transmission were crucial for sustaining the local juristic community.  Both our earliest Mālikī biographical dictionaries, and the majority of manuscript evidence testifying to an intensive scholarly activity in Qayrawān comes from the 4th/10th century when Ifrīqiya came to be ruled by the Fatimid dynasty, who openly challenged the juristic community of Qayrawān, yet hardly suppressed their teachings  in a way that is often assumed by modern scholars. Not only there is little evidence that the Fāṭimids persecuted scholars, but there is also more evidence to confirm that the Mālikī scholarly community of Ifrīqiya consolidated and thrived under the Fāṭimid rule.
As Mālikī legal works were compiled and commented upon by several generation of legal scholar in the Islamic West, members of the scholarly community also took care to commemorate their peers and forerunners in biographical collections. The earliest extant collection, Abū al-ʿArab al-Tamīmī’s (d. 332/944) Ṭabaqāt ʿulamāʾ Ifrīqiya is also from the 4ht/10th century. His ṭabaqāt was continued by his student al-Khushanī (d. 370/981?) titled Ṭabaqāt ʿulamāʾ Ifrīqiya wa-Tūnis, then by al-Mālikī’s (d. c. 967/1081) Riyāḍ al-nufūs, ʿIyāḍ’s (d. 544/1149) Tartīb al-madārik, Ibn Idhārī’s al-Bayān al-mughrib and al-Dabbāgh (d. 696/1295) and Ibn Nājī’s (d. 837/1433) Maʿālim al-īmān.  These works connected the scholars of the Islamic West to Mālik b. Anas and Medina, through stories such as the one about Saḥnūn’s compilation of the Mudawwana, and others who came before and after him. Within the framework of the ṭabaqāt and local history, these authors were also abe to connect the memory of these scholars to the history of their home region – Ifrīqiya, which reinforced the illusion of stability and continuity of the community, which is what spaces do for memory. 
On the other hand, the descendants of Muslim settlers from the east, like Abū al-ʿArab – a descendent of the garrison commander of Tunis who chose scholarly pursuits over a military career, wrote the history of Ifrīqiya into the grand narrative of Islam. The earliest memory of the Muslim community in the Maghrib thus revolves around the stories of the conquest, and reinforcing the Muslim frontiers (ribāṭa).  Abū al-ʿArab Ṭabaqāt begins with a section “on the virtues of Ifrīqiya", where the Prophet is quoted telling his companions: "You will mobilise armies and the best among them will be the army of the Maghrib."  The introductory chapter then continues with praising the Muslim settlers of Ifrīqiya who arrived in the Maghrib for jihād and ribāṭ, and a Prophetic hadith is cited through several narrators: “People of my community from Ifrīqiya will rise on the Day of Resurrection with their faces brighter than the full moon.”  These traditions praise and give credit to the virtuous Muslim settlers of Ifrīqiya, among them “the companions of the Prophet and those who came with the companions during their campaigns,” and the followers (tābiʿīn) who had personal limks to the East, are mentioned before the ʿulamāʾ and fuqahāʾ “generation after generation.”  The remembrance and commemoration of the earliest settlers, especially through reusing the powerful tropes of jihād and ribāṭ, and re-enacting and performing this memory remained important for many generations of scholars to come, including through participating in real combat. 
From the stories of their forefathers to personal memories of participation in military campaigns, jihād and ribāṭ were significant for the memory processes of the juristic community of 10th-11th century Ifrīqiya. The Fāṭimid rulers, who had replaced the Aghlabids following a dramatic takeover in 909 CE, but whose control over Ifrīqiya faded gradually towards mid 5th/11th century, came to be remembered as the antiheroes, especially after the Zīrid ruler turned against them. This political reality, as well as local and trans-local rivalries with other communities, thus inevitably played a part in the formation of communities and their sense of identity.
In the following century, this tension not only kept the memory of the latter’s direct rule in Ifrīqiya relevant but overtly political. The Fāṭimids had to be vilified, and their oppression remembered. As the hatred for the Fāṭimids grew, Mālikī biographers lionised local heroes. These include the hagiographies (manāqib) for al-Qābisī (403/1012) and Muḥriz b. Khalaf (d. 413/1022), who taught Abū Bakr al-Mālikī’s father. Another important influence on Abū Bakr al-Mālikī was his teacher ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Ajdābī  (d. 432/1040), who composed hagiographies of four militant ascetics who had joined the rebellion of Ibāḍī Berbers led by Abū Yazīd al-Nukkārī (d. 335/947) against the Fāṭimids.  Although Al-Ajdābī’s writings have not survived directly, it is his generation whose remembrance of the early Fāṭimid period with elements of anti-Fāṭimid propaganda, including fantastical details, made it into al-Mālikī biographical collection.
In addition to memories of struggle and perseverance, biographical collections make use of evocative narratives of suffering, namely trial (miḥna, pl. miḥan) and martyrdom. Already an established and culturally familiar theme across religions, utilised most effectively by the Shīʿis, biographers cast their members who clashed with the authorities as martyrs and oppressed. Abū al-ʿArab devoted an entire book to the subject which he titled The Book of Trials (Kitāb al-Miḥan), while al-Khushanī wrote an entire separate chapter in his Ṭabaqāt listing scholars who had been punished or executed by the rulers. The repetition of these stories arguably played a crucial role for consolidating and sustaining the scholarly communities such as the Mālikīs of Ifrīqiya:

You have asked me, may God protect you from the Devil and his actions, to compile a book mentioning the scholars, jurists, saints, ascetics and pioneers of Qayrawān and Ifrīqiya, including those along the coasts of Ifrīqiya and its ports and forts. I sought God’s guidance, took Him as my guide, and asked for His help, then recorded whatever information had reached me of their pious men and ascetics, their merits and praises, and their dates of death, to the extent of my capacity. I saw this as a way of commemorating them (iḥyāʾan li-dhikrihim) and spreading their merits to be remembered by those who commit [things] to memory, and as an example of guidance for those who seek a model and for the pious. 

This is how Abū Bakr al-Mālikī introduced his project to revive the memory of the pious men of Ifrīqiya in a compilation of written and oral material that he called Riyāḍ al-nufūs (Garden of Souls).  The fact that Abū Bakr al-Mālikī does not explicitly brand his work a specifically Mālikī work of ṭabaqāt but rather seems to adopt a larger perspective is noteworthy.  There is no doubt that Abū Bakr al-Mālikī was a staunch Mālikī; the reason for his omission of any explicit reference to Mālik or his madhhab may have been simply that Mālikī scholars in his time still identified largely with the school of Medina, rather than the person of Mālik b. Anas. The reuse of the Riyāḍ al-nufūs in Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ’s (d. 544/1149) emphatically Mālikī Tartīb al-madārik wa-taqrīb al-masālik li-maʿrifat aʿlām madhhab Mālik  (see Figure 1) reveals that the former must have been a model for Qāḍī ʿIyād, as well as one of his major sources on the Mālikīs of Ifrīqiya.

 
Figure 1. The reuse of biographical material from the Riyāḍ al-nufūs (top) in Tartīb al-madārik (bottom). The text of the books, divided into chunks of 300 tokens is laid along the x-axis, while y-axis shows the length of the aligned passages in each book. (The blank space in the beginning corresponds to editorial introductions.)


Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ’s Tartīb al-madārik quotes the Riyāḍ more than it does any other book. The data also shows that Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ reused all of the extant parts of the Riyāḍ in composing his Tartīb al- madārik. As a memory practice, biographical text reuse and the commentary tradition were essential for perpetuating Mālikīsm, and the distant reading approach proposed here may help our understanding of the Mālikisation of the Islamic West. In this regard, works of ṭabaqāt, transmission (riwāya), commentary (sharḥ) and abridgement (mukhtaṣar) complement each other in the consolidation of the juristic community.
Mālikī historians and biographers presented a history of the Islamic Maghrib that served to legitimise their community, connecting it to revered Arab pioneer settlers in the Maghrib and ultimately to the ṣaḥāba (the Prophet’s companions) and the Prophet. While integrating the Maghrib into the broader history of Islam, they appear to suppress the memory of other communities and disfavoured rulers. Elsewhere, the biographies combine the ideals of piety, asceticism, standing guard at the frontiers, avoiding and denouncing rulers, especially the Fāṭimids, in order to create convincing individual profiles and a collective portrait of the pious men of Ifrīqiya. 
That said, to assume that Mālikī historians and narrators were deliberately ideological in their remembrance of the past is perhaps too simplistic. Rather, there was a more complex process of meaning-making at work that predetermined their reception and recollection of the past and their arrangement and presentation of the available material. This process involved repetitive practices that enforced or promoted a particular identity, but also mundane activities that were hardly driven by ideology.  The biographical collections represent the first type – i.e. intentional memorialisation, while textual transmission is the less conspicuous form of memory practice, to which we return through the case of Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd  and textual practices centred on his Mudawwana, below. Before discussing the memory of Saḥnūn, it is worth further examining the narratives of struggle, suffering, and heroism, which we think are most relevant to communal identity formation for their poignancy, their capacity to evoke a sense of pride, and their putative status as most worthy of commemoration. 

Narratives of Struggle and Suffering

It is known that experiences of war and violence are often the focus of communal remembrance, both because of the trauma and suffering, and the haunting visual experience. But it is also known that one does not need to witness or experience these events personally. Moreover, insofar as these narrative plots are culturally familiar, they provide templates for telling new stories about more recent heroes. And because narratives of defiance, sacrifice and martyrdom play a key role in sustaining communities, they remain a productive theme in telling the story of the past to the point of being repetitive. The repetition of the patterns, as we observe in hagiographies and folk stories, is, however, hardly because of the lack of imagination on the part of the authors. Rather, as in the case of the stories of martyrdom or miḥna (ordeal, trial), the narrator aims to register the story as a repetition of the archetypal miḥna. The narrator is almost forced to change the story to fit the “culturally circulated stories,” in order for it to be meaningful.  As Kashima suggests, "the appropriation of culturally circulated stories" – in this case narratives centred around stories of piety, poverty, defiance, miḥna, jihād, ribāṭ and so on – would “result in the adoption of the stories’ goals."  Thus, the ṭabaqāt are not just a compilation of the pious deeds of exemplary scholars, but also a framework for telling the story of the community.  At the same time, as studies on the psychology of memory have shown, the existence of these cultural and social frameworks, or templates, has a direct influence on the formation of these recollections.  “False memory syndrome,” or adopting “common autobiographical stories about traumatic experiences and their negative consequence” is a known phenomenon in cognitive psychology.  One may go a little further and posit that in a similar way believable and culturally familiar tropes can also feed into cultural memory. For, as Straub observes,

[t]o visualize the past and history, one employs images and a language which is never completely one’s own. A person recollecting past events imagines and narrates them as a member of a certain culture […]. Without its symbolic forms and means one would search in vain for a specifically human memory. Without them, all those memories and narratives which help us vividly visualize and communicate the past and history of humankind, or even of one single individual, would disappear. 

These observations highlight the power of the ṭabaqāt over cultural memory, but these narratives are not restricted to the ṭabaqāt. Indeed, they are borrowed from the larger biographical tradition that was not unique to Arabs, Muslims, or only Sunni Muslims. In narratives that mirror the Biblical story of Moses, as well as Christian martyrology,  Ismāʿīlī, Ibāḍī and Mālikī authors of the Maghrib highlight the perseverance of their respective heroes in the face of oppression, using not only similar literary devices but often identical metaphors. In Ismāʿīlī polemical narratives, the non-Shīʿī jurists and scholars were accused of complicity in the legitimation of the unjust caliphs.  In a work written in the form of a didactic dialogue, the Kitāb al-ʿālim wa’l-ghulām, presumably during the revolutionary phase of the Fāṭimid daʿwa in the Yemen, Jaʿfar b. Manṣūr argued that the jurists were in fact worse than the usurpers of the caliphate, for: “Were it not for the opinions passed down and circulated by the legal scholars [riwāyāt al-fuqahāʾ], [...] the oppressors could not maintain their dominion over the foolish ones.”  The lengthy dialogue of course makes ample references to the “murder” and “suffering” of the Shīʿī imams at the hand of their oppressors. While Ismāʿīlī authors like Jaʿfar b. Manṣūr also maintained a cyclical understanding of time, framing the injustices (and their consequences) as an inevitable part of history, the narrative pattern of “righteous community ->> oppressor ->> martyrdom ->> relief/reward/victory” was shared by other communities.  Given how common this pattern was, it is hardly surprising that the Fāṭimid caliphs were themselves casted as impostors and tyrants by their Mālikī adversaries.

It is useful to consider the medieval Ismāʿīlī dāʿīs as a “control group” to highlight the wider cultural relevance of these narratives. While the Fāṭimid-Ismāʿīlī scholars did not produce a single ṭabaqāt work, they also relied on narratives of martyrdom and trials to legitimize their cause. A model of this genre is al-Qāḍī al-Nuʿmān’s Kitāb al-Manāqib waʾl-mathālib (Book of Virtues and Vices), in which he enumerates the vices of the Umayyads, an old rival of the Hāshimid clan and its ʿAlid branch that came head to head with the Fāṭimids (who were ʿAlids) one last time in the Maghrib.  For this major Fāṭimid author and his readers, the memory of the old battles in the Hijāz and ʿIrāq and the martyrs were therefore directly relevant to the political realities of the time, namely the confrontation with the Umayyads of al-Andalus. 
Finally, as Judith Pollmann has shown in the case of early modern Europe, while memory practices related to war and violence, such as the ones mentioned above, may begin much later in time, they also depend on others similar memories, and are shared by the victims only when it is possible to give them a positive meaning.  Pollmann also highlights the comforting role of religion in reframing memories of trauma, for which we have a perfect example from Qayrawān, Abū al-ʿArab al-Tamīmī’s introduction to his Kitāb al-miḥan, a long list of martyrdoms and ordeals beginning with the murder of the second caliph ʿUmar and ending with the persecution of scholars in his own time. According to this redemptive scheme, the suffering of Muslims, especially the pious among them is nothing but a blessing from God: indeed, the Prophet has said that “my people will suffer the most in this world”, and “the prophets and the righteous will suffer most”.  Another hadith that includes Saḥnūn in its isnad says: “every nation has a punishment and the punishment of my nation is the sword”.  In addition to the Prophet, there is a quote from the famous early Jewish convert to Islam, Kaʿb al-Aḥbār,  who was known as an expert of the sacred scriptures: “When you see swords unsheathed and blood spilled, know that God’s command had been forfeited; when you see the plague spread, know that adultery had spread; and when you see the rain was kept, know that the alms (zakāt) had been kept; when people withhold what is theirs  to give, God withholds what is his.”  The aim of these memory strategies, such as commemorating the martyrs, was also to create a solidarity community across the world, not too dissimilar from that described by Pollmann, with a shared memory of the losses, suffering, triumphs and defeats of the past. 
While equally polemical, narratives of triumph and defeat are not about self-pitying and victimhood. Instead, they are deployed in polemical texts to target rival communities, and cast representatives of the authors’ own communities as heroes.  Whereas in narratives of martyrdom and miḥna, defiant heroes suffer at the hands of tyrants, in narratives of polemics they demonstrate excellence and triumph. The most illustrative examples of these are found in the narratives of debates (munāẓara), which are usually presented as truthful accounts of polemical encounters.  The popularity of this genre among all religious communities and the abundance and circulation of texts attests to their role in creating competing communal memories.
On the contrary, humiliation and defeat present an inconvenience that must be justified by memory communities. For survivors, these experiences are traumatic and shameful, and cannot be used to promote a positive image of themselves or their community.  The memory of Abū Yazīd’s long-lasting but ultimately failed rebellion against the Fāṭimids is a telling example, which put both the Ibāḍīs and the Mālikīs who supported Abū Yazīd in an embarrassing situation, while it helped the Fāṭimids to secure their control over Ifrīqiya. Because of the importance of this victory for Fāṭimid propaganda, it was celebrated with parades,  commemorated in poetry and speeches, and implicit references were made to it in coinage and inscriptions.  Likewise, the victors made the most of Abū Yazīd’s corpse after he was killed, parading with it in all towns of Ifrīqiya before crucifying it in al-Mahdiya, after a ship which meant to take it to Sicily for a victory parade there sank off the coast of Ifrīqiya. When parading with the flayed corpse in the rebel town Tāhert, Fāṭimid imam-caliph al-Manṣūr billāh also ordered the dead bodies of former rebel governors of Tāhert Masāla b, Ḥabūs and his brother Yaṣal be exhumed and burned together with the pulpit of the mosque from where the name of the Umayyad caliph had been proclaimed.  It was not only an act of revenge and a message to the Andalusian caliph and the rebels he supported,  but also the erasure of all traces of defeat by the caliph who had adopted the regnal title al-Manṣūr bi-naṣr-Allāh that is ‘the Victorious with the Help of God’. At the same time, the defeated parties, the Ibāḍīs and the Mālikī jurists of Qayrawān had to come up with justifications for taking part in the rebellion, which, as Walker and Madelung have suggested, was one of the reasons for the portrayal of the Fāṭimids as heretical extremists in Mālikī historiography.  The damnatio memoriae of Abū Yazid also befell the Fāṭimids when their rule came to an end: their names was erased even from their own tombstones.
As these examples amply demonstrate, social memory is anachronistic and fluid. Remembrance and commemoration of individuals, events, and the narrative format of these memories were crucial for imagining the past and having a sense of a communal identity. Traumatic memories, wars, violence, and heroic acts readily fit culturally familiar frameworks for storytelling. While the framing of the past stories was determined by the present, they were also oriented towards the future, aimed at motivating the actors to behave in accordance with the imagined tradition, propagating allegiance to one madhhab over others. That these allegiances and networks were only occasionally harnessed by temporal political powers, less so conflated with state identity (there are exceptions) probably ensured the durability of these communities in a way that a tribal identity, for example, could not. (KENNEDY) Therein lies the power of a minority, but highly connected scholarly class and its control over the memory of the Muslim community. (These imagined communities were purportedly independent of states and bound together different ethnic groups across the Muslim world). The following pages will focus on one and arguable the most illustrious jurist of medieval Qayrawān to illustrate how a community of jurists functioned across several generations.

Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd was an influential transmitter of the legal opinions of the scholars of Medina (and Egypt), students of Mālik b. Anas, to a large number of students of Ifrīqiya and al-Andalus.  Being the most senior among those who never met or directly studied with Mālik, his laborious endeavour to compile the legal knowledge from all direct students of Mālik paid off. The number of his disciples is reported to have reached seven hundred, attracting both scholars and ascetics from all corners of the world.  He is credited for the triumph of Mālikism in Ifrīqiya through the dissemination of his legal compendia, the Mudawwana, which, as mentioned in the story of its composition, compiled and consolidated a great deal of Mālik’s teaching.  The transmission of these works, accompanied by an emerging textual tradition, went back to Saḥnūn through his closest associates and numerous disciples, including his son, also a prolific scholar, Muḥammad b. Saḥnūn (d. 256/870). While most scholars have sought to reconstruct Saḥnūn’s legal works, biography, number of disciples, and so on, based on textual and material evidence, it is likely that the portrait of Saḥnūn is likely a later construction, even if the Mudawwana was largely the product of his own efforts.  Biographical dictionaries do record Saḥnūn’s high esteem among his contemporaries, but it is also clear that the full measure of his contribution was only appreciated/realised in the tenth century.

 
Figure 2. While Saḥnūn’s Mudawwana builds on the opinions of Mālik b. Anas it also includes much material that is not found in the Muwaṭṭa, including opinions of other Mālikī jurists, aḥādīth and āthār: (top Muwatta, bottom Mudawwana). Some scholars (notably Norman Calder, Nicolle Cottart) believed that the text of the Mudawwana was not fixed during Saḥnūn’s lifetime.
Modern scholarship has followed the classical Mālikī consensus about the pre-eminent role of Saḥnūn’s oeuvre in consolidating Mālikism in Ifrīqiya and al-Andalus.  Material evidence – manuscript fragments from Raqqāda collection confirm Saḥnūn’s Mudawwana as the most widely transmitted text. Although their dating to the 3rd/10th century is problematic, some of the oldest (non-Qurʾanic) textual fragments preserved in the collection of the Great Mosque of Qayrawān are from the Mudawwana, one of them believed to have been written during Saḥnūn’s lifetime (a single folio written before 235 AH).  It needs to be  explained, therefore, why and how this compilation, often presented as a transmission of Mālik’s legal opinions through his Egyptian student Ibn al-Qāsim (d. 191/807), should have surpassed the efforts of all other legal schools and jurists in North Africa and al-Andalus. What is more, as mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the original compilation, on which Mudawwana was supposedly based, according to the Mālikīs’ own belief, was actually compiled by Asad b. al-Furāt following a Ḥanafī framework.  The answer is often sought either in the text of the Mudawwana (what made it so outstanding?), or in the Aghlabid patronage, which made Qayrawān such a thriving environment for legal studies?), without considering the social and political context in which Saḥnūn’s legacy and memory was circulating.  Therefore, the focus is on the early Fāṭimid period (4th/10th century), in which the majority of our biographical texts and much of the extent manuscript evidence was produced and the Mālikī school was consolidated.
The earliest biographies of Saḥnūn present a more modest portrait of him than the later, even including reservations by some of his own students, including reservations abou the merit of his Mudawwana.  At the same time, many other works by Mālikī authorities were in circulation, including the above-mentioned Asadiyya.  Thus, the image of Saḥnūn, created by later generations as a prodigious and exemplary champion of the Mālikī school, I suggest, was less due to his activity as a jurist, or as a champion of the public against the Aghlabids, than to the consolidation of the Mālikī madhhab/memory – community, which crystallised during the Fāṭimid period, and was in need of local heroes. Transmission of Mālikī legal knowledge compiled in the Mudawwana (Figure 3), played a crucial role in this process, and can be demonstrated through the intensity of the transmission of his works attested in the ṭabaqāt and surviving manuscripts (Figures 4).
 
Figure 3. Major authorities quoted in the Mudawwana. The graph represents the occurrences of explicit citation from top six Mālikī authorities per milestone (300 tokens, roughly one printed page) across the text of the Mudawwana, which has almost 1 million words/tokens divided into 3000 milestones. As a search term, I used “qāla”+ “narrator.” For comparison, there are 107 hadith quoted using the formulation “qāla rasūl Allah.”

 
Figure 4. An overview of the textual network formed through participation in transmitting the same texts. The red links represent authoring (taʾlīf, taṣnīf, etc.), and green links represent transmission (riwāya) of a book (orange nodes) by an author – represented by a colour according to one of the four periods. This network is based on information from biographical dictionaries, in many cases attested in transmission notes on manuscripts compiled by Miklos Muranyi in his Beiträge. Please refer to the interactive version of the network, which allows filtering by clusters and by period: https://aslishah.github.io/Qayrawan/ 
As the visualisation of the textual network shows, while Saḥnūn was not a prolific author in a sense that he has not left us any other book, his massive compilation the Mudawwana was one of the most transmitted works among the Mālikī community, effectively a school textbook. The network also confirms that Saḥnūn’s authority was not undisputed. The isolation of the venerated scholar and major source for Mālikī biographers, Saʿīd b. al-Ḥaddād, who apparently did not take part in the transmission of legal works by his predecessors, including his teacher Saḥnūn, is a case in point. The study of his personal networks in the Mālikī ṭabaqāt confirms the reports that he was somewhat ostracised by the Mālikī community. Yet, he was posthumously rehabilitated and accorded a prominent position in the Mālikī biographical dictionary, particularly because of his disputations with the Fāṭimid dāʿīs.  Saḥnūn himself does not appear as prominent as one might expect, because he did not produce many titles, however, his Mudawwana is central to the network and most of the other scholars participate in its transmission. An interactive version of this graphic is currently available online: https://aslishah.github.io/Qayrawan/ which will be improved and made available with this publication.
The surviving catalogue of the manuscript collection of the Great Mosque of Qayrawān, and the collection itself demonstrates the growing significance of the Mudawwana in the Fāṭimid and Zīrid period. There is no doubt that the Mālikī jurists used Saḥnūn’s works in their day-to-day activities, an obvious reason for its intense transmission.  As manuscript and text reuse data show (Figure 7), by the Zīrid period the Mudawwana became the most transmitted work in Qayrawān. At the same time, the biographies of Saḥnūn expanded and separate accounts of his virtues were composed, as noted above.
The scholars of Qayrawān many of whom were Saḥnūn’s students, remembered him as a staunch defender of the school of Medina (Mālikīs) in the context of bitter revenge and humiliation from the ʿIrāqīs (Ḥanafīs) in the late Aghlabid period (late third/ninth century). Only a handful of the students and contemporaries of Saḥnūn, who had memories of him, lived into the early Fāṭimid period and transmitted eyewitness accounts alongside his emerging hagiography to a new generation of Mālikīs, who, almost sixty years after his death, began to compile the accounts of his virtues (manāqib).  The Fāṭimid reality, especially the state’s pressure on the jurists is thus key to understanding the formation of the Mālikī memory, which excluded not only rival communities (Shīʿīs, Ibāḍīs, Ḥanafīs), but also plurality and disagreement within the community. For instance, the Ifrīqiyans who followed al-Shāfiʿī were later reclaimed by the Mālikīs. Abū Bakr al-Mālikī’s father, who was known as “al-Shāfiʿī,” was ostensibly encouraged by his teacher al-Qābisī to change his nisba to “al-Mālikī,” which points to the major preoccupation of the authors of the ṭabaqāt.
	The activities of the juristic community of Qayrawān centred around the transmission of the Mudawwana amounted to a canonisation of a sort. According to Aleida Assmann, canonisation involves a) the maintenance of texts, as I have reconstructed in Figure 4; b)  the maintenance of meaning, which is signalled by the emergence of commentaries and abridgements, as captured by text reuse evidence (Figure 6, 7; Appendix 1); and c) censorship, of which the censorship of Asad b. al-Furāt and his contribution is one example.  Textual evidence also allows us to reconstruct the transition from the communicative, almost autobiographical narration of the Mudawwana, and its function as a school  text (as shown by Miklos  Muranyi and Jonathan Brockopp), to cultural memory in its final shape, spanning 80-100 years, as described by Jan Assmann.  The appearance  of the massive Kitāb al-Nawādir waʾl-ziyādāt by Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī, dealing with cases not included Saḥnūn’s compilations, as well as his “book  by  book and chapter by chapter” abridgement entitled Ikhtiṣār al-Mudawwana waʾl-Mukhtaliṭa, not only confirms  the “closure” or the consolidation of the text, but also its canonicity.  For sceptics, the early 5th/11th century abridgement by al-Barādhiʿī (Fig 4), and the Jāmiʿ li masāʾil al-Mudawanna (Appendix 1) by the contemporary Ibn Yūnus al-Siqillī, should leave no room for doubt that by this time the Mudawwana had already achieved its status as the most authoritative compendium of the Mālikī school in Qayrawān and Ifrīqiyya.
	
 
Figure 5. Top: Tahdhīb al-Mudawwana, an important abridgement of Saḥnūn’s Mudawwana, by Abū Saʿīd al-Barādhiʿī al-Qayrawānī (d. 438/1046-47); bottom: Mudawwana, after Ibn Abī Zayd’s (d. 386/996) Ikhtiṣār, with which the tradition of making abridgements of Saḥnūn’s Mudawwana begins. These abridgements and multiple early commentaries testify to the popularity of the book and had practical significance for teaching..
These activities went hand in hand with the growing importance of Saḥnūn in the community’s remembrance of its past, which can be captured by Pierre Nora’s concept lieux de mémoire or “the sites of memory.” The remembrance of Saḥnūn by later generations who were mostly removed from Saḥnūn’s Qayrawān in time or space, like tenth century Abū al-ʿArab and al-Khushanī, and Abū Bakr al-Mālikī who wrote a century later after the total destruction of Qayrawān, like Abū Bakr al-Mālikī, were inevitably shaped by their own environments.  Subsequently, as Brockopp notes, contradictory stories about Saḥnūn  are reported as historical facts in modern scholarship.  In reappraising the biographical tradition, my aim is not to downplay the crucial role of the historical Saḥnūn and his teaching, but rather to interpret the role of the hagiographic accounts elaborated by Mālikī scholars from the Fāṭimid period onwards in the formation of the tradition. This is also the context for a process in which the mudawwana (compilation) of Asad b. al-Furāt, became the Mudawwana of Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd and transmitted on his authority among the expanding Mālikī network (see Figure 7).



 
Figure 6. Saḥnūn’s network of students and teachers. The network of Saḥnūn and his Mālikī teachers and students based on the Ṭabaqāt al-ʿulamāʾ by Abū al-ʿArab al-Tamīmī (d. 333/945). Students associated with a teacher are identified and coloured by a clustering algorithm.
 Alongside the transmission of the Mudawwana, the collective remembrance of Saḥnūn by his students and their students, a group often connected through more than textual networks, passed on between generations of Mālikīs.  Since this “remembrance” or “reconstruction of the past” was inevitably embedded in their present, as Halbwachs had postulated,  it must also reflect the memory processes that shaped the Mālikī community, especially the most important religious and political change in Ifrīqiya since the time of Saḥnūn – the Shīʿī Fāṭimids’ takeover of the Aghlabid state in 909, who then challenged the fuqāhāʾ’s authority as “heirs to the Prophet.” The implication of the political context for the Mālikī community of Qayrawān therefore needs closer consideration.
If inter-madhhab competition and the need for consolidation led to the construction of a heroic image for Saḥnūn in the memory of his tenth-century colleagues, for a similar reason his stature came to be eclipsed by  that of his teacher Ibn al-Qāsim, who was elevated above Saḥnūn in the process of the codification or creating a uniform theory for Mālikī law in the post-classical period.  Up until the 7th/13th century, text reuse evidence demonstrates the continuous importance of the Mudawwana for the Mālikīs in Ifriqiyya. (See, Figure 7: systematic commentary on the Mudawwana). However, the need for a uniform doctrine led to the rise of the new forms of mukhtaṣar, which for the Mālikīs seems to have started with Ibn Shās’s ʿIqd al-Jawāhir al-Thamīna, then Ibn al-Ḥājib’s (d. 646/1248) Jāmiʿ al-ummahāt, and culminated in the famous Mukhtaṣar Khalīl of Khalīl b. Isḥāq al-Jundī (d 749/1348 or 767/1365).  The popularity of Ibn al-Ḥājib’s mukhtaṣar among the Mālikīs in both Egypt and in the Maghrib, alongside the above-mentioned Tahdhīb al-Mudawwana, was already observed by his later contemporary Ibn Khaldūn.   These highly technical, and complex works seem to have gradually rendered the classical textbooks, such as the Mudawwana, obsolete.  

 
Figure 7. Text reuse pattern in Saḥnūn’s Mudawwana shows that the three top reusers are abridgements of the work. These systematically quote 100-word chunks from the Mudawwana. See, the graphical representation of the top two reuser Ibn Yūnus’s Jāmiʿ in Appendix 1, and Abū Saʿīd al-Qayrawānī’s Tahdhīb in Figure 5 above. There are also other works which do not quote the text systematically, but they are important indicators of the canonicity of the Mudawwana, such as al-Jubbī’s (d.450/1058) Kitāb sharḥ gharīb alfāẓ al-Mudawwana, which again indicates that the commentator assumed the work to have been a closed corpus.
	In the long run, as Ahmed El Shamsy has argued, the proliferation of the commentary tradition, seem to have obscured the classics only to be revived in the modern age. By the beginning of the twentieth century no complete copy of the Mudawwana could be found in either Egypt or Tunisia, which led Muḥammad Abduh (d. 1905) to fetch a copy from Morocco for the first Egyptian edition of 1905-05.  Unlike the classical unambiguous acknowledgement of Saḥnūn as the compiler of the Mudawwana, modern editions tend to attribute the Mudawwana to Mālik b. Anas highlighting Ibn al-Qāsim’s role as its transmitter, echoing the post-classical shift from Saḥnūn to Ibn al-Qāsim and Mālik b. Anas.  Ironically, when the edition appeared in July 1905, Abduh’s own contribution was left unacknowledged: there was no mention of him in the colophon, making him the last casualty of traditionalism. 

Part 2. Narrative Frameworks of Memory: Ṭabaqāt as Memory Texts
Much of what has been discussed above, including the personality of the scholars, their standing within the community, social relations, and credentials is preserved and transmitted in the biographical dictionaries of the Mālikī school, also called ṭabaqāt and tarājim. The biographical dictionaries are first and foremost commemorative communal texts, which serve to define the community. Scholars have long debated about the function of Muslim biographical collections, categorising them variously from encyclopaedia and reference tools to communal histories.  However, most of them seem to agree on at least one important characteristic of the genre: that it presented an argument for a community, and its legitimacy in the case of a scholarly community. The ṭabaqāt connected the scholars of a madhhab in successive generations back to the Prophet. Modern scholars still seem to give priority to this function of the ṭabaqāt as the main motivation behind these repetitive compositions. The focus here is, however, on the role of the ṭabaqāt as a product of memory communities, and on the significance of the “horizontal” mode of knowledge transmission  and the rise of the ṭabaqāt. This approach contrasts with that of the Ismāʿīlīs, who, unlike many other Muslim communities, did not compose works of ṭabaqāt.
	The contrast with the Ismāʿīlīs among others, is significant. As Shahzad Bashir has recently argued, the ṭabaqāt create a sense of community across generation, even within a generation, between people who had no interaction. This allows us to observe “how variation between biographical genres [and perhaps other genre] leads to radically different temporalities pertaining to a single socio-political context.” 
	
As a traditionalist group, the Mālikīs sustained a continuous interest in compiling ṭabaqāt beginning with the late third/eighth and early fourth/ninth centuries.  The function of the ṭabaqāt was, Makdisi maintained, “to distinguish between those who had the necessary knowledge to be qualified as authoritative, and those who did not,” aimed at empowering “a certain group of scholars to the exclusion of others.”  Limiting the utility of the ṭabaqāt for a particular group - the traditionalists, Makdisi also downplayed the interest of other groups in compiling biographical dictionaries, including kalām theologians, poets, Qurʾān reciters, and others. Conversely, Tarif Khalidi discounted the primacy of ḥadīth and concerns of authenticity and authority and included a wider range of “literary interests,” such as pre-Islamic “genealogy and chain of poetic transmission,” early Islamic “short biographies” of the companions of the Prophet, the ʿulamāʾ and other prominent people, and only lastly the “lists of [ḥadīth] transmitters” as the precursors to biographical dictionaries.  More recently, Michael Chamberlain and Wadad al-Qadi linked biographical collections to the self-consciousness of the ʿulamāʾ as a class, and to social struggle and survival.  In a survey of the two earliest extant Mālikī biographical dictionary of the scholars of Ifrīqiya, Maribel Fierro also shows the significance of books, their writing, ownership and circulation as a form of social capital in the third-fourth/ninth-tenth century Maghrib, as reflected in the ṭabaqāt.  In another study, Maribel Fierro views the ṭabaqāt as a repository of memory, practice, and networks of religious scholars.  Michael Cooperson, emphasised the function of biography in bolstering the claims of various social groups to “heirship of the prophet,” among them the ʿulamāʾ, and drew attention to “the power of biography in creating and sustaining of communities of faith.”  Claims to the heirship of the Prophet seems to have been an important function of the biographical collections. This also must have been the reason why the Ismāʿīlī scholars and dāʿīs, who considered only the Ismāʿīlī imams as the rightful heirs of the Prophet, did not compose biographical dictionaries.

At the turn of the 9^th^ century, two learned men entered Ifrīqiya each
carrying a compendium of Islamic law with him. One of them, Asad b.
al-Furāt (d. 213/828), had grown up in Qayrawān, where he returned after
a three year journey in pursuit of knowledge in Ḥijāz, ʿIrāq, and
Egypt.[^2] His book was a compilation of legal opinions transmitted from
Mālik b. Anas by his Egyptian student Ibn al-Qāsim al-ʿAtakī (d.
191/807), with whom Asad studied in Egypt, although he had also directly
studied with Mālik b. Anas in Medina and with several students of Abū
Ḥanīfa in ʿIrāq, thus connecting himself to the two most prominent
jurists of the time. Asad b. al-Furāt's compilation known as *Asadiyya*
gained him admiration among the legal scholars of Qayrawān, until it was
superseded by an updated recension of it, brought to Qayrawān by a local
scholar Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd around AD 804.[^3] To achieve this, Saḥnūn had
to take a copy of the *Asadiyya* to Egypt, read it to Ibn al-Qāsim and
revise it. To stop Asad b. al-Furāt from teaching his old version, Ibn
al-Qāsim sent him a letter, which clearly upset him, but according to
the Mālikī tradition, he reluctantly accepted the authoritativeness of
the rival compilation of Saḥnūn, now called the *Mudawwana*.[^4] For the
Mālikī community of the Islamic West and for Saḥnūn's students, the
*Mudawwana* would become their most authoritative legal work. It also
represented the crowning achievement of their teacher and their
scholarly community as a whole, while Asad b. al-Furāt would be mainly
remembered as the conqueror of Sicily for the Aghlabids.

The second book was brought by Abū Ghānim Bishr b. Ghānim al-Khurāsānī.
It was also called *Mudawwana* (later called *al-Mudawwana al-ṣughrā*),
but it had nothing to do with the Mālikīs. This book belonged to the
Ibāḍi community, and is considered "the oldest Ibāḍī treatise on general
jurisprudence", based on the teachings of the Basran Ibāḍi scholar, Abū
ʿUbayda Muslim al-Tamīmī (d. circa 136-58/754-75).[^5] Abū ʿUbayda was
recognised as an Ibāḍī imam and is known for organising and dispatching
Ibāḍī missionaries called *ḥamalat al-ʿilm* (bearers of knowledge).[^6]
One of the first missionaries sent by Abū ʿUbayda, Abū'l-Khaṭṭāb
al-Maʿāfirī managed to capture Tripoli and even Qayrawān for a brief
period, where he appointed ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Rustam (r. 161-71/778-88),
the future founder of the Rustamid state of Tahert, as the governor.[^7]
Abū Ghānim, who belonged to another generation of the *ḥamalat al-ʿilm,*
was thus travelling to Tahert to visit the second Rustamid imam ʿAbd
al-Wahhāb b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, (r. 171-208/788-824). The Ibāḍī tradition
preserves an interesting memory of his passing by Jabal Nafūsa, the
Ibādī stronghold in Ifrīqiya, which highlights the importance of his
*Mudawwana* for the survival of the community:

> When Abū Ghānim Bishr b. Ghānim al-Khurāsānī travelled from the
> Mashriq to the Maghrib to have an audience with the \[Rustamid\] imam
> ʿAbd al-Wahhāb \[(168-208/784-823)\] -- may God be pleased with him
> --he had brought his famous *Mudawwana* with him. He transmitted it
> from the students of AbūʿUbayda -- may God be pleased with him -- and
> had fixed the transmission in writing. On the way to Tahert, he passed
> through the Jabal Nafūsa, where  he  entrusted the  above-mentioned
> book to the young ʿAmrūs, but declined his request to copy it. So
> ʿAmrūs contemplated copying the book \[without permission\] and
> eventually was given to his desire for knowledge, so he devoted
> himself to the task of copying the book while his sister dictated to
> him.[^8] He would \[copy\] the book until the sun reached him. Then he
> would move to sit in the shadow for copying, with the original copy
> still in his sister\'s hands, but his eyes fixated on the writing
> because of his extreme passion for the revival of knowledge (*ʿilm*).
> By the time Abū Ghānim returned from Tahert, ʿAmrūs had completed the
> copying. Then he put it back where it was. When the owner retrieved
> the \[original\] book, he saw an ink dot on a part of it and asked
> him: Did you steal this? He replied: Yes, call me a knowledge thief,
> by transmitting not by stealing (*akhbāran lā amran*?). This book

> good fortune.\"[^9]

Both stories reveal the importance of the written word as the
cornerstone of communal memory and identity both for the urban
Arabic-speaking Mālikīs and the Berber-speaking Ibāḍīs of the mountains.
The rise of the Shīʿī Fāṭimids in the tenth century put an end to the
Ibāḍī state of Tahert and suppressed several major Ibāḍī uprisings in
the mountains. Likewise, the Mālikī scholars of Qayrawān, although
largely left to their own devices, saw the Fāṭimids as a threat to their
community. Deprived of state patronage, both communities had to rely on
strategies of their own to maintain their communal identities and
boundaries.[^10] Thus, their real struggle was, as expressed in the
quotation above by Abū Zakariyyā al-Wārjalānī, a struggle against
oblivion.

In this chapter we explore the mechanisms, instruments, and above all
the incentives that maintained these communities. We ask what sustained
the socio-cultural and ideological continuity that was vital to their
survival as distinct communities? Answering these questions will
hopefully provide fresh insights into the cultural memory of Muslims,
and the numerous subgroups that produced the textual heritage of Islam.
In the following pages, we discuss the interdependence of texts,
narratives, and memory in the formation of the most important community
of religious scholars in the Islamic West, the Mālikīs. After
introducing the Mālikī juristic community, we discuss the commemorative
function of their biographical collections, and then
discuss the case of Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd and his *Mudawwana,* a foundational
text for the Mālikī jurists.

Juristic communities, especially the early Mālikīs of the Islamic West
and their works have been studied but rarely from the perspective of
memory studies. This perspective helps to bring out the social function
of memories and the contexts that made them significant to the Mālikī
community. Text reuse methods add additional insight into the process of
the formation of the cultural memory of the Islamic West in which the
Mālikīs played a prominent role. Reuse data shows how knowledge-text
(both legal texts and biographies) was accumulated over time to form
massive compilation, then condensed into shorter but much more practical
abridgements (*mukhtasar*, *ikhtisār,* etc) (Figure 1 and 4).

The Mālikī Community of Qayrawān

In the medieval world, religion was perhaps a stronger marker of
community than other forms of belonging, although tribal affiliations
often intersected with religious proclivities, thereby acquiring
religious meaning. The rural medieval Maghrib with its predominantly
Berber population provides an interesting case of the interplay between
tribal and religious affiliations,[^11] which could be usefully compared
with the urban centres predominantly occupied by Arabs and other
Arabised Muslims. For the latter, at least for the educated elite, the
biographical collections inform us that religious belonging increasingly
played a more prominent role as a marker of community than tribal and
regional ties. The biographers seldom stigmatise people because of their
origins as long as they are part of the Mālikī network. Thus, gradually,
in the cosmopolitan and literate societies of the Islamic world, among
the learned people, a new type of belonging emerged that was defined by
strong legal and doctrinal positions and occasionally by mutually
exclusive interpretations of religion, which were fittingly called
*madhāhib* (sing. *madhhab*, way, method).[^12] The *madhhab,* even in
the loose sense of the word, became an important form of affiliation,
networking, and knowledge transmission in Muslim urban centres.
Likewise, riots and conflicts between rival groups in Muslim cities
often coincided with inter-*madhhab* hostilities.[^13] The external
antagonism between the *madhāhib* testifies to an equally strong
internal social bond between the members. As will be argued, texts and
textual networks constituted the most vital instruments for the
legitimation, preservation and promotion of these scholarly communities.

Taking the Mālikī scholarly community, one of the oldest extant
*madhhab*-based communities in Islam we examine the role of texts,
specifically the foundational legal texts based on the teachings of
Mālik b. Anas (d. 179/795), and their biographical dictionaries in the
formation and consolidation of the community. However, we will not begin
with the discussion of the 2^nd^/8^th^ century, when Mālik codified the
practice (*ʿamal*) of the inhabitants of Medina in his *Muwaṭṭaʾ* (the
first legal work in Islam) for all Muslims to follow, or the
transmission of this influential work to Egypt, the Maghrib, and
al-Andalus in the following two centuries, and its numerous recensions
and commentaries. These activities contributed to the rise and dominance
of a religious orientation and a scholarly culture in the cultural
centres of the Islamic West, especially Qayrawān and Cordoba, that
coalesced around the legal opinions of Mālik.[^14] The so-called
"Ancient Library", a collection of texts that survive from the period,
shows how crucial textual memory was for sustaining the juristic
community of Qayrawān.[^15] Instead of surveying the early history of
the community, we begin in the 5^th^/11^th^ century, when Mālikism,
after having been only one among several competing schools, had come to
dominate most of the Islamic West. Naturally, proponents of the Mālikī
*madhhab* viewed the history/fate of the religion as intertwined with
the memory of their Mālikī predecessors, to the exclusion of other
communities:

> You have asked me, may God protect you from the Devil and his actions,
> to compile a book mentioning the scholars, jurists, saints, ascetics,
> and pioneers of Qayrawān and Ifrīqiya, including those along the
> coasts of Ifrīqiya and its ports and forts. I sought God's guidance,
> took Him as my guide, and asked for His help, then recorded whatever
> information had reached me of their pious men and ascetics, their
> merits and praises, and their dates of death, as far as was within my
> capacity. I saw this as a way of commemorating them *(iḥyāʾan
> li-dhikrihim)* and spreading their merits to be remembered by those
> who commit \[things\] to memory, and an example of guidance for those
> who seek a model, and for the pious.[^16]

This is how Abū Bakr al-Mālikī prefaced his project to revive the memory
of the pious men of Ifrīqiya, one could say reviving them in memory, a
compilation of written and oral material, which he called the Garden of
Souls (Full title: *Kitāb Riyāḍ al-nufūṣ fī ṭabaqāt ʿulamāʾ al-Qayrawān
wa Ifrīqiya wa-zuhhādihim wa-nussākihim wa-siyar min akhbārihim
wa-faḍāʾilihim wa-awṣāfihim*; Garden of the Souls on Generations of the
Scholars of Qayrawān and the Pious Men and Ascetics Among Them:
Anecdotes from their Lives, Their Virtues, and Qualities). The fact that
Abū Bakr al-Mālikī does not explicitly brand his work as a Mālikī work
of *ṭabaqāt,* but rather seems to adopt a larger perspective is
noteworthy.[^17] There is no doubt that Abū Bakr al-Mālikī was a staunch
Mālikī. I think this is simply because the Mālikī scholars still largely
identified with the school of Medina, rather than the person of Mālik b.
Anas. As we can see from the reuse of the *Riyāḍ al-nufūs* in Qāḍī
ʿIyāḍ's (d. 544/1149) emphatically Mālikī *Tartīb al-madārik wa taqrīb
al-masālik li-maʿrifati aʿlām madhhab Mālik*[^18] in Figure 1 below, the
former must have been a model for Qāḍī ʿIyād, as well as one of his
major sources on the Mālikīs of Ifrīqiya.

**Figure 1**. The reuse of biographical material from the *Riyāḍ
al-nufūs* (top) in *Tartīb al-madārik* (bottom). According to our
current data, *Tartīb al-madārik* quotes from the *Riyāḍ* more than any
other book. The data also shows that all of the extant parts of the
*Riyāḍ al-nufūs* have been used as a source by Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ in composing
his *Tartīb al-madārik.* (NB: The blank space in the beginning
corresponds to editorial sections).

Memory studies perspective helps to see why collecting memories mattered
for the community. Text reuse was an important part of the formation of
cultural memory for the Mālikīs as it was elsewhere. In turn, the study
of text reuse, an important aspect of Islamicate written tradition,
contributes to memory studies.

Mālikī historians and biographers presented a history of the Islamic
Maghrib which served to legitimise their community alone, connecting it
to revered Arab pioneer settlers in the Maghrib, and ultimately to the
*saḥāba,* and the Prophet. While integrating the Maghrib into the
broader history of Islam, they deliberately suppressed the memory of
other communities and of the rulers that they did not favour. This is
why the Mālikī biographical collections are less concerned with the
Fāṭimids' construction of mosques, cities, and canals, fortifications,
or of their defeating the Byzantines, although accounts of the Fāṭimids'
aggression against the Mālikī community, and their other alleged
misdeeds are abundant. Not only had any positive mention of the Fāṭimids
been written out of history during the era of the Zīrids who gradually
broke away from the Fāṭimids, but the Fāṭimids were also publicly cursed
and any association with them was retrospectively downplayed.[^19]

That being said, to assume that Mālikī historians and narrators were
constantly self-censoring in their remembrance of the past is perhaps
too simplistic. Rather, there was a more complex process of
meaning-making at work, that predetermined their reception and
recollection of the past, and the arrangement and presentation of the
available material.[^20] In what follows we will deal with this aspect
of communal memory as reflected in the elaboration of the *ṭabaqāt --*
commemorative biographical texts of various Muslims groups. In
particular, we will focus on three types of narratives, namely
narratives of struggle, suffering and heroism, which we think most
relevant to communal identity formation for their poignancy, evoking a
sense of pride, and being most worthy of commemoration. Then we will
look at one specific example: the figure of Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd and the role
of his *Mudawwana* in the formation of Mālikism.

Narrative Frameworks of Memory: *Ṭabaqāt* as Memory Texts

Before discussing the significance of the *ṭabaqāt* texts in the
formation of memory communities and cultural memory a brief review of
the genre is in order. Scholars of the medieval Muslim biographical
tradition seem to agree on at least one aspect of the genre: that it
presents an argument for the legitimacy of a scholarly community. The
*ṭabaqāt* connected the scholars of a *madhhab* in successive
generations back to the Prophet. Modern scholars still seem to give
priority to this function of the *ṭabaqāt* as the main motivation behind
these repetitive compositions. The focus here is, however, on the role
of the *ṭabaqāt* as a product of memory communities, and the connection
the mechanisms and modes of Sunni "horizontal" knowledge
transmission[^21] and the rise of the *ṭabaqāt*. This approach contrasts
with that of the Ismāʿīlīs, who, unlike many other Muslim communities,
did not compose works of *ṭabaqāt.*

As a traditionalist group, the Mālikīs sustained a continuous interest
in compiling *ṭabaqāt* beginning with the late third/eighth and early
fourth/ninth centuries.[^22] The function of the *ṭabaqāt* was, Makdisi
maintained, *"*to distinguish between those who had the necessary
knowledge to be qualified as authoritative, and those who did not,"
aimed at empowering "a certain group of scholars to the exclusion of
others."[^23] Limiting the utility of the *ṭabaqāt* for a particular
group - the traditionalists, Makdisi also downplayed the interest of
other groups in compiling biographical dictionaries, including *kalām*
theologians, poets, Qurʾān reciters, and others. Conversely, Tarif
Khalidi dismissed the primacy of *ḥadīth* and concerns of authenticity
and authority and included a wider range of "literary interests," such
as pre-Islamic "genealogy and chain of poetic transmission," early
Islamic "short biographies" of the companions of the Prophet, the
*ʿulamāʾ* and other prominent people, and only lastly the "lists of
\[*ḥadīth*\] transmitters" as the precursors to biographical
dictionaries.[^24] More recently, Michael Chamberlain and Wadad al-Qadi
linked biographical collections to the self-consciousness of the
*ʿulamāʾ* as a class, and to social struggle and survival.[^25] In a
survey of the two earliest extant Mālikī biographical dictionary of the
scholars of Ifrīqiya, Maribel Fierro also shows the significance of
books, their writing, ownership and circulation as a form of social
capital in the third-fourth/ninth-tenth century Maghrib, as reflected in
the *ṭabaqāt*.[^26] In another study, Maribel Fierro views the *ṭabaqāt*
as a repository of memory, practice, and networks of religious
scholars.[^27] Michael Cooperson, emphasised the function of biography
in bolstering the claims of various social groups to "heirship of the
prophet," among them the *ʿulamāʾ,* and drew attention to "the power of
biography in creating and sustaining of communities of faith."[^28]
Claims to the heirship of the Prophet seems to have been an important
function of the biographical collections. This also must have been the
reason why the Ismāʿīlī scholars and *dāʿīs*, who considered only the
Ismāʿīlī imams as the rightful heirs of the Prophet, did not compose
biographical dictionaries.[^29]

*a) Narratives of Struggle: Jihād and Ribāṭ*

The foundational narrative of the Muslim community in the Maghrib, as
remembered by the Mālikīs, is linked to the conquest of the region
(*fatḥ,* pl. *futūḥ/futūḥāt*) by Muslims, their *jihād* and guarding the
frontiers (*ribāṭ*) against potential Byzantine attack from the sea.
This narrative frames the story of the community as a continuum, while
anecdotes about individual members embody ideals such as continuous
perseverance, self-sacrifice, and striving in the path of God (*jihād fī
sabīli-llāh*).[^30] This is exemplified by the *Ṭabaqāt ʿUlamāʾ
Ifrīqiya* of Abū'l-ʿArab al-Tamīmī, whose family belonged to the
military aristocracy, like many of his Ifrīqiyan colleagues who
descended from Arab and Khurāsānī troops. Unsurprisingly, prophetic
traditions about Ifrīqiya are used to highlight the virtue of the armies
sent to the Maghrib. According to one such tradition reported by
Abūʾl-ʿArab in the section "on the virtues of Ifrīqiya\", the Prophet
told his companions: \"You will mobilise armies and the best among them
will be the army of the Maghrib.\" [^31] The inclusion of these
traditions, which had become part of the collective memory, through the
books of *ṭabaqāt* and *akhbār* (histories), served to highlight the
place of Ifrīqiya within the grand narrative of Islam, but also to
glorify the "jihādist" ancestors, who appealed to the increasingly
militant Mālikīs. In turn, Ifrīqiya with its frontiers and cities,
importantly Qayrawān, became the locus of the "collective thought" of
the scholars and the believers of Ifrīqiya.[^32]

Within this overarching framework, each anecdote speaks to a common
theme thus making it possible to identify each individual as a member of
the community. Let us begin by considering the case of the prominent
physician and a historian of the early Fāṭimid period, Ibn al-Jazzār (d.
369/979), the author of a number of historical works and many
influential medical treatises. He lived in Qayrawān and is said to have
refused Fāṭimid patronage as a general pious principle. At the same
time, he is said to have been a close friend of Abū Ṭālib, uncle of the
imam-caliph al-Muʿizz's, and "visited him every Friday."[^33]
Nevertheless, our Mālikī source, the Andalusian Ibn Juljul (d. after
384/994), emphasised his dissociation from the Fāṭimids. His claims
cannot be taken at face value, particularly in light of the fact that
Ibn al-Jazzār authored a history of the foundation of the Fāṭimid state
titled *Akhbār al-dawla,* which is now lost, but quotations from it
survive in many other works,[^34] including Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's
*Ṭabaqāt,* where he favourably contrasts the Fāṭimid leader Abū ʿAbd
Allāh al-Shīʿī with the ousted Aghlabids.[^35] What about the fact that
Ibn al-Jazzār had a comfortable life in Qayrawān and did not emigrate?
According to Ibn Juljul, he indeed "intended to emigrate to al-Andalus
but did not succeed."[^36] Neither did he receive any favours from the
Fāṭimids, asserts this account.[^37] As a general principle of piety, it
was important for Mālikī biographers to dissociate the pious from the
ruler. Ibn Juljul and and Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa', however, worked for Umayyad
and Mamluk patrons. While these two physicians were probably less
concerned with piety, it is obvious that by dissociating from the "Banū
ʿUbayd," as their adversaries called the Fāṭimids,[^38] both of them
affirmed their allegiance to their anti-Fāṭimid patrons.[^39]

Ibn al-Jazzār is also said to have taken part in guarding the Muslim
frontiers (*ribāṭ, rābiṭa)*, which is a recurring topos in line with the
rising militant Mālikism in the Maghrib. According to this narrative,
Ibn al-Jazzār "annually performed *rābiṭa* at the coast \[fort\] of
Monastir on the shore of the Byzantine Sea (*al-baḥr al-Rūmī*), which is
a place of *murābaṭa* known for its *baraka* (blessing), where he would
stay during the days of the midsummer \[heat\] and then return to
Ifrīqiya \[i.e. Qayrawān)."[^40] The wealthy physician was not an
ascetic, and thus, one would assume, would not qualify for pious
mentions, such as withdrawing from the public, distancing himself from
the rulers, or volunteering for *ribāṭ* and *jihād.* One can only
speculate whether Ibn al-Jazzār was escaping the summer heat of Qayrawān
for the pleasant breeze of the Mediterranean shore, or whether he was
genuinely seeking *baraka* in the sacred place of *ribāṭ* and its pious
dwellers, and taking part in this pious pastime himself.[^41] But it is
clear that this mention is not a random detail from the life of Ibn
al-Jazzār, but a trope that places him among the pious forefathers,
whose remembrance served to legitimise and consolidate the Mālikī
community*.*

Ibn al-Jazzār's case is interesting because he is an unlikely individual
to be claimed as a militant ascetic. Indeed, Abū Bakr al-Mālikī has not
listed him in the *Riyāḍ* but only mentions him in relation to his
medical practice. In addition, al-Mālikī cites a remark made by al-Ḥakam
II, the Umayyad caliph of Cordoba, that supports our contention:

> Al-Ḥakam said: 'There are only four \[men\] that I wish I had from the
> little Shīʿa state (*al-dawlat al-shuwayʿī,* i.e. the Fāṭimids):
> Abūʾl-Qāsim b. Ukht al-Ghassānī al-Maqarrīʾ, the poet Ibn al-Ṣayqal,
> the physician Ibn al-Jazzār, and Ibn al-Qaṣṭaliyya the chanter
> (*mughabbir*). Eventually, Abūʾl-Qāsim b. Ukht al-Ghassānī al-Maqarrīʾ
> and the poet Ibn al-Ṣayqal, reached him \[al-Ḥakam\] and stayed with
> him until they died, but Ibn al-Qaṣṭaliyya and Ibn al-Jazzār did not
> travel \[to al-Andalus\].'[^42]

For al-Mālikī, there were far more prominent ascetics and anti-Fāṭimid
heroes in Qayrawān than Ibn al-Jazzār to be valorised and included among
religious scholars. Nonetheless, we should be in no doubt that the way
Ibn al-Jazzār's biography was recorded also reflects similar concerns of
his biographers.

Although *ribāṭ* and *jihād* narratives were generally used to bolster
the Muslim community, in the Mālikī *ṭabaqāt,* their utility comes handy
for the uplift of the Mālikī community in their intra-Islamic struggle
with the Ḥanafīs, the Ismāʿīlīs, and others. The ascetic militant shaykh
Jabala b. Hammūd is said to have returned from a frontier *ribāṭ* to
Qayrawān allegedly to guard against the Fāṭimids. At the same time, the
Mālikī narrative vilifies the Fāṭimids for dismantling and disrespecting
the *ribāṭ*s, a space that Mālikī ascetics identified with
strongly.[^43] One ascetic, Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥasan b. Naṣr al-Sūsī (d.
341/952), is reported to have confronted the Fāṭimid prince Ṭāhir, the
caliph al-Manṣūr's paternal cousin, and his companions for allegedly
coming to the place of *ribāṭ,* the Castle of Ṭāriq in Sūsa, with
*muskir* (wine or other intoxicating drink) and other "means of
entertainment." He sent people to tell the Fāṭimid prince: "You have
brought illicit items to the Muslim place of *ribāṭ* and one of their
frontiers (*ribāṭ al-Muslimīn wa-thaghr min thughūrihim*). Leave, or we
will fight you until you leave."[^44] The prince was forced to leave
after spending a night in the place built near the Castle.

In another episode, Jabala excuses himself from visiting al-Manṣūr, who
passed by Sūsa after defeating Abū Yazīd. The ascetic refuses to go with
Jawhar, the caliph's famous servant. Al-Manṣūr sends Jawhar back to tell
the shaykh: "\[The caliph\] is grieved that you cannot join his company;
he sends you his regards and asks you to pray for him." He replies:
"Tell him, 'may God correct you and your judges for the sake of all
Muslims.' And he did not say anything more than this," -- end of
story.[^45] This is the basic template for depicting the relationship
between the pious men and the Fāṭimids. Elsewhere, the biographies
combine the ideals of piety, asceticism, standing guard at the
frontiers, avoiding and denouncing rulers, especially the Fāṭimids, in
order to create individual profiles and a collective portrait of the
pious men of Ifrīqiya.[^46]

### *b) Narratives of Suffering: Martyrdom and Miḥna*

It is known that experiences of war and violence are often the focus of
communal remembrance, both because of the trauma and suffering and the
haunting visual experience. But the emotional and visual aspect of the
stories need not to be witnessed or experienced individually. Insofar as
these narrative plots are culturally familiar, they provide templates
for telling new stories about more recent heroes. And because narratives
of defiance, sacrifice and martyrdom play a key role in sustaining
communities, they remain a productive theme in telling the story of the
past to the point of being repetitive. The repetition of the patterns,
as we observe in hagiographies and folk stories, is, however, hardly
because of the lack of imagination on the part of the authors. As in the
case of the stories of martyrdom or *miḥna* (ordeal, trial), the
narrator who passes down this story aims to register the story as a
repetition of the archetypal *miḥna*. From this perspective, we could
assume that the narrator is almost forced to change the story to fit the
"culturally circulated stories," in order for it to be meaningful.[^47]
As Kashima suggests, \"the appropriation of culturally circulated
stories\" -- in the present case narratives centred around stories of
piety, poverty, defiance, *miḥna,* *jihād, ribāṭ* and so on -- would
"result in the adoption of the stories' goals.\"[^48] Thus, the
*ṭabaqāt* are not just a compilation of the pious deeds of exemplary
scholars, but also a framework for telling the story of the community.
At the same time, as studies on the psychology of memory have shown, the
existence of these cultural and social frameworks, or templates, has a
direct influence on the formation of these recollections.[^49] "False
memory syndrome," or adopting "common autobiographical stories about
traumatic experiences and their negative consequence" is a known
phenomenon in cognitive psychology.[^50] One may go a little further and
posit that in a similar way believable and culturally familiar tropes
can also feed into cultural memory. For, as Straub observes,

> \[t\]o visualize the past and history, one employs images and a
> language which is never completely one's own. A person recollecting
> past events imagines and narrates them as a member of a certain
> culture \[...\]. Without its symbolic forms and means one would search
> in vain for a specifically human memory. Without them, all those
> memories and narratives which help us vividly visualize and
> communicate the past and history of humankind, or even of one single
> individual, would disappear.[^51]

These observations highlight the power of the *ṭabaqāt* over cultural
memory, but these narratives are not restricted to the *ṭabaqāt.* Indeed
they are borrowed from the larger biographical tradition that in turn
transcends the boundaries of the cultural memory of Islam. It is useful
to consider the medieval Ismāʿīlī *dāʿī*s as a "control group". While
the Fāṭimid scholars did not produce a single *ṭabaqāt* work, they also
relied on narratives of martyrdom and trials to legitimize their cause.
A model of this genre is al-Qāḍī al-Nuʿmān's *Kitāb al-Manāqib
waʾl-mathālib* (*Book of Virtues and Vices*), in which he enumerates the
vices of the Umayyads, an ancient rival of the Hāshimid clan and its
ʿAlid branch that came head to head with the Fāṭimids (who were ʿAlids)
one last time in the Maghrib.[^52] The memory of the old battles in the
Hijāz and the martyrs are therefore directly related to the political
realities of the time, namely the confrontation with the Umayyads of
al-Andalus. It is also not surprising that Fāṭimid *daʿī*s attacked the
jurists as one of the main pretenders to religious knowledge and
authority amongst Muslims. A century before Abū Bakr al-Mālikī, when the
Fāṭimids were still controlling Ifrīqiya and inter-madhhab hostilities
were somewhat contained, the Fāṭimid *dāʿī* Jaʿfar b. Manṣūr al-Yaman
(d. ca. 346/957) wrote:

In narratives that parallel the Biblical story of Moses, as well as
Christian martyrology,[^54] Ismāʿīlī, Ibāḍī and Mālikī authors of the
Maghrib highlight the perseverance of their respective heroes in the
face of oppression, using not only similar literary devices but often
identical metaphors. In the Ismāʿīlī narrative above, the jurists, of
course, could not have been cast as pharaohs, a role reserved for the
ʿAbbāsid and Umayyad caliphs. Nonetheless, the *dāʿī* accused them of
complicity in the legitimation of the unjust caliphs. In a work written
in the form of a didactic dialogue, the *Kitāb al-ʿālim wa'l-ghulām,*
presumably during the revolutionary phase of the Fāṭimid *daʿwa* in the
Yemen, Jaʿfar b. Manṣūr argued that the jurists were in fact worse than
the usurpers of the caliphate, for: "Were it not for the *opinions
passed down and circulated by the legal scholars* \[*riwāyāt
al-fuqahāʾ*\], \[\...\] the oppressors could not maintain their dominion
over the foolish ones."[^55] The lengthy dialogue of course makes ample
references to the "murder" and "suffering" of the Shīʿī imams at the
hand of their oppressors. While Ismāʿīlī authors like Jaʿfar b. Manṣūr
also maintained a cyclical understanding of time, framing the injustices
(and their consequences) as an inevitable part of history, the narrative
pattern of "righteous community -\>\> oppressor -\>\> martyrdom -\>\>
relief/reward/victory" was shared by other communities.[^56] It is
hardly surprising that the Fāṭimid caliphs were themselves depicted as
impostors and tyrants by their adversaries.

In the eleventh century, the political tension between the Sinhāja
Zīrids, rulers of Ifrīqiya, and their Fāṭimid overlords in Egypt kept
the memory of the latter's direct rule in Ifrīqiya not just relevant but
overtly political.[^57] The Fāṭimids had to be vilified, and their
oppression remembered. In Abū Bakr al-Mālikī's lifetime, which witnessed
the apogee of Qayrawān's glory and then its destruction, the rise of
militant "Shīʿa-phobia" paralleled the growth of Mālikī hagiographies.
Abū Bakr's father, who adopted the *nisba* "al-Mālikī," had already
compiled two hagiographies (*manāqib*) for his teachers al-Qābisī
(403/1012) and Muḥriz b. Khalaf (d. 413/1022). Another important
influence was his master ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Ajdābī[^58] (d. 432/1040),
who composed hagiographies of four militant ascetics who had joined the
rebellion of Ibāḍī Berbers led by Abū Yazīd al-Nukkārī (d. 335/947)
against the Fāṭimids.[^59] Al-Ajdābī's work has not reached us directly,
but quotes from this and similar accounts form the basis of al-Mālikī's
compilation. His is the generation that passed down the collective
memory of the early Fāṭimid period to Abū Bakr al-Mālikī's generation.
In the context of the Shīʿa-phobia of his time, one can expect that the
only politically relevant stories to be recorded were the ones that
vilified the Fāṭimids. This continued political contingency of the
post-Fāṭimid period makes it a challenge to reconstruct the real
circumstances of the encounters between the Fāṭimid elite and the
*fuqahā\'*. Therefore, we ought to pay closer attention to the format
and function of the texts that served first and foremost the interest of
the community, who constructed and passed on the memory of their
venerated heroes ("sites of communal memory"

*c) Narratives of Triumph and Defeat*

Polemical texts often target rival communities, attack their position,
and cast representatives of the authors' own communities as heroes.[^60]
Whereas in narratives of martyrdom and *miḥna*, defiant heroes suffer at
the hands of tyrants, in narratives of polemics they demonstrate
excellence and triumph. The most illustrative examples of these are
found in the narratives of debates (*munāẓara*)*,* which are usually
presented as truthful accounts of polemical encounters.[^61] The
popularity of this genre among all religious communities and the
abundance and circulation of texts allow for a cross-examination of
their role in creating competing communal memories.

On the contrary, humiliation and defeat present an inconvenience that
has to be rationalised by memory communities. The memory of Abū Yazīd's
unsuccessful rebellion against the Fāṭimids is a telling example which
put both the Ibāḍīs and the Mālikīs who supported Abū Yazīd in an
embarrassing situation, while it helped the Fāṭimids to secure their
control over the Maghrib. Because of the importance of this victory for
Fāṭimid propaganda, they could not have this forgotten and commemorated
the victory in poetry and speech, and made implicit references to it in
coinage and inscriptions.[^62] Therefore, both the Ibāḍīs and the
Mālikīs had to come up with justifications of their actions (I hope to
discuss this later).

### The Memory of Saḥnūn and Textual Networks in Qayrawān

Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd (d. 854) was a venerated teacher who succeeded in
passing on the teaching of the scholars of Medina (and Egypt) to a large
number of students in Qayrawān and al-Andalus.[^63] The number of his
disciples is reported to have reached 700, most likely an arbitrary
estimation, if not a symbolic number, but a sure testimony to the
special position accorded to him by later generations.[^64] He is
credited for the triumph of Mālikism in Ifrīqiya through his students
who disseminated his recension of Mālik b. Anas's *fiqh,* titled
*al-Mudawwana* and *al-Mukhtaliṭa.*[^65] The transmission of these
works, accompanied by an emerging textual tradition, went back to Saḥnūn
through his closest associates and numerous disciples, including his
son, also a prolific scholar, Muḥammad b. Saḥnūn (d. 256/870). However,
it is reasonable to suggest that the portrait of Saḥnūn is as much a
later construction as the *Mudawwana* is the product of efforts by
several generations of scholars.[^66]

![](./media/image2.png){width="5.057716535433071in"
height="2.8472222222222223in"}

**Figure 2.** While Saḥnūn's *Mudawwana* builds on the opinions of Mālik
b. Anas it also includes much material that is not found in the
*Muwaṭṭa,* including opinions of other Mālikī jurists, *aḥādīth* and
*āthār:* (top *Muwatta,* bottom *Mudawwana*). Some scholars (notably N.
Calder, Nicolle Cottard) believed that the text of the *Mudawwana* was
not fixed during Saḥnūn's lifetime.

Recent studies have emphasised the importance of Saḥnūn's oeuvre in
consolidating Mālikism in Ifrīqiya and al-Andalus.[^67] The five oldest
dated (non-Qurʾanic) textual fragments preserved in the ancient
collection of the Great Mosque of Qayrawān are also from the
*Mudawwana,* one of them written during Saḥnūn's lifetime (a single
folio written before 235 AH).[^68] It is difficult to explain, however,
without considering the intellectual and political context, why and how
this compilation, mostly based on a transmission of Mālik's legal
opinions through his Egyptian student Ibn al-Qāsim (d. 191/807), should
have surpassed the efforts of all other legal schools and jurists in
North Africa and al-Andalus. The answer is often sought either in the
legal text - the *Mudawwana* itself (what made it so outstanding?), or
in the Aghlabid context (what made Aghlabid Qayrawān such a brilliant
environment for legal studies?). Saḥnūn himself is considered an
outstanding jurist of his time, despite the reservations of some of his
own students. After all, the *Mudawwana* was considered notoriously
imperfect by some.[^69] At the same time, many other similar works were
in circulation, not least the above-mentioned *Asadiyya,* by Saḥnūn's
prominent local competitor Asad b. al-Furāt.[^70] The heroic image of
Saḥnūn, created by later generations as a prodigious and exemplary
champion of the Mālikī school, we suggest, was less due to his activity
as a jurist, or as a champion of the public against the Aghlabids, than
to the consolidation of the Mālikī *madhhab/memory --* community, which
crystallised during the Fāṭimid period, and was in need of local heroes.
This argument can be demonstrated through the intensity of the
transmission of his works attested in the *ṭabaqāt* and surviving
manuscripts (Figures 3-4).

**Figure** **3.** This is an example of a textual network, that is a
network formed through participation in transmitting the same texts. The
dark and light green links represent the transmission of Mālikī
knowledge (mostly *fiqh;* each book represented by a rectangle page)
during the Fāṭimid and Zīrid period. This network is based on
information from biographical dictionaries, in many cases attested in
transmission notes on manuscripts compiled by M. Muranyi in his
*Beiträge*. Note that Saḥnūn was not a prolific author, although his
compilation *al-Mudawwana* was one of the most transmitted works among
the Mālikī community in the following centuries (see **Figures**
**3-4**). Also note the isolation of the venerated Mālikī
disputationist, Saʿīd b. al-Ḥaddād, who actually did not take part in
the transmission of legal works by his predecessors, including his
teacher Saḥnūn, though he was an avid storyteller and a major source of
biographical information about the Mālikī scholars. The study of his
personal networks in the Mālikī *ṭabaqāt* also shows that he was
somewhat ostracised by the Mālikī community. Yet, he was posthumously
rehabilitated in the memory of the community and accorded a prominent
position.[^71] NB. In this particular visualisation, the algorithm makes
prolific authors more prominent, such as Saḥnūn's son Muḥammad. Saḥnūn
himself is not labelled because he did not author many books. However,
his *Mudawwana* is central to the network and most of the other scholars
participate in its transmission.

The surviving catalogue of the manuscript collection of the Great Mosque
of Qayrawān, and the collection itself demonstrates the growing
significance of the *Mudawwana* in the Fāṭimid and Zīrid period. As
shown in Figure 4, by the Zīrid period the *Mudawwana* became the most
commonly transmitted work in Qayrawān. At the same time, the biographies
of Saḥnūn expanded and separate accounts of his virtues were composed,
as noted above.

![](./media/image4.gif){width="5.105650699912511in"
height="3.8608923884514437in"}

**Figure 4.** This figure is another visualisation of the above network,
which shows the growing prominence of the *Mudawwana* of Saḥnūn. The
coloured circles on the left represent Mālikī scholars, and the dark
blue circles on the right represent books they transmitted. Size of the
circles represents the number of transmitters. The transmission is
particularly intense in the Fāṭimid (dark green) and Zīrid period (light
green), although the *Mudawwana* is consistently popular from the early
Aghlabid (light blue) to later Aghlabid period (brown).

The scholars of Qayrawān many of whom were Saḥnūn's students, remembered
him as a staunch defender of the Mālikī *madhhab* in the context of
bitter revenge and humiliation from the ʿIrāqīs (Ḥanafīs) in the late
Aghlabid period (late third/ninth century). Only a handful of the
students and contemporaries of Saḥnūn, who had memories of him, lived
into the early Fāṭimid period and transmitted eyewitness accounts
alongside his emerging hagiography to a new generation of Mālikīs, who,
almost sixty years after his death, began to compile the accounts of his
virtues (*manāqib*).[^72] The Fāṭimid reality is thus key to
understanding the formation of the Mālikī cultural memory, which
excluded not only rival communities (Shīʿīs, Ibāḍīs, Ḥanafīs), but also
plurality and disagreement within the community. For instance, the
Ifrīqiyans who followed al-Shāfiʿī were later reclaimed by the Mālikīs.
Abū Bakr al-Mālikī's father, who was known as al-Shāfiʿī, was allegedly
encouraged by his teacher al-Qābisī to change his nisba to "al-Mālikī,"
which points to the major preoccupation of the authors of the *ṭabaqāt.*

![](./media/image5.png){width="5.054375546806649in"

Figure 5. *Tahdhīb al-Mudawwana,* an abridgement of Saḥnūn's
*Mudawwana,* by Abū Saʿīd al-Barādhiʿī comes second (?), after Ibn Abī
Zayd's (d. 386) *Mukhtasar,* with which the tradition of making
abridgements of Saḥnūn's *Mudawwana* begins*.* These abridgements and
multiple early commentaries testify to the popularity of the book and
had practical significance for teaching.

As noted earlier, the concept *lieux de m*é*moire* can explain the
emergence of the collective memory in Qayrawān centred on the figure of
Saḥnūn among later generations of scholars. The "sites of memory", as
opposed to "environments of memory" (*milieux* *de mémoire)* are not
directly connected with the real context; rather, as in our case, they
are the collective (and nostalgic) memory of later generations who were
mostly removed from Saḥnūn's Qayrawān in time or space, or both. Whether
they wrote about Qayrawān from al-Andalus, like al-Khushanī, or wrote
after the decline of Qayrawān, like Abū Bakr al-Mālikī, they found in
the figure of Saḥnūn a metaphorical "site of memory" where they could
deposit[^73] their diverse values and ideals.[^74] Subsequently, as
Brockopp notes, these and similar stories are reported as historical
facts in modern scholarship.[^75] Our attempt is, of course, not to
downplay the crucial role of the historical Saḥnūn and his teaching, but
rather to interpret the hagiographic accounts elaborated by Ifrīqiyan
scholars from the Fāṭimid period onwards. This is the context for a
process in which the *mudawwana* (compilation) of Asad b. al-Furāt,
became the *Mudawwana* of Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd and transmitted on his
authority among the expanding Mālikī network (**see Appendix 1**).
Alongside with the transmission of the *Mudawwana,* the collective
remembrance of Saḥnūn by his students and their students, a group often
connected through more than textual networks, passed on between
generations of Mālikīs.[^76] Since this "remembrance" or "reconstruction
of the past" is inevitably embedded in their present, as Halbwachs had
postulated,[^77] it is the "remembered" part that matters for our
understanding of the processes that shaped the Mālikī community*.*

To appreciate properly the concerns of the scholars of Qayrawān, and the
motivations behind their "individual," "collective" or "historical"
memories, one must pay attention to their pressing concerns and
challenges in this period. As Patrick J. Geary reminds us, memory is
political by nature and "the political and intentional dimension of
memory cannot be ignored."[^78] The most important political change in
Ifrīqiya since the time of Saḥnūn was the Shīʿī Fāṭimids' takeover of
the Aghlabid state (800-909), whose doctrines challenged the *fuqāhāʾ'*s
authority as "heirs to the Prophet." This case is evidently political.
Therefore, the formation of the memory and identity of the Mālikīs must
be examined against this background and, more importantly, in comparison
with the Fāṭimids' counter-narrative.

Further in this section I plan to look at the text reuse of the
*Mudawwana* in more detail. Here is an overview of the text reuse
pattern (systematic borrowing/commentary) for the top three reusers of
the *Mudawwana* (**Figure 6** below. Next, I will divide the book into
chapters of specific topics of law. Since law was often taught and
transmitted topic by topic, it would be interesting to see if this is
reflected in text reuse data.

![](./media/image6.png){width="5.057716535433071in"
height="3.7083333333333335in"}

**Figure 6.** Text reuse pattern in Saḥnūn's *Mudawwana* shows that the
three top reusers are probably abridgements of the work as they rarely
quote more than 100 word chunks, but systematically borrow shorter word
chunks for the entire book.

NB:

*I plan to add two more shorter sections, one on the Ibāḍīs and one on
the Ismāʿīlīs. I have had conflicting feedback about adding this
comparison. I had written a section on the Ismāʿīlīs, but I have removed
it for now.* Two more potential sections:

1.  **A Community of Elite -** here I look at the Fatimids used texts
    and narratives to define their community in opposition to the
    Malikis and other Sunni communities.

2.  **The Ibāḍīs** - by contrast the Ibāḍīs are egalitarian and
    emphasise community, community leaders and the role of knowledge and
    communal memory.

    itself: the collective thought of the group of believers has the
    best chance of immobilizing itself and enduring when it concentrates
    on places, sealing itself within their confines and moulding its
    character to theirs." Halbwachs, *The Collective Memory,* 156 (*La
    mémoire collective*, 165)

[^33]: Ibn Juljul, *Ṭabaqāt al-aṭibbāʾ,* 89. According to Ibn Abī
    Uṣaybiʿa, *ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ,* 481: "on Fridays."

[^34]: Walker, *Exploring an Islamic Empire,* 178;

[^35]: Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, *ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ,* 480. There Ibn al-Jazzār
    quotes his teacher, Isḥāq b. Sulaymān al-Isrāʾīlī, the Jewish
    physician, who had then entered al-Mahdī's service. As suggested,
    these accounts also shed light on Ibn al-Jazzār's own relationship
    with the Fāṭimids.

[^36]: Ibn Juljul, *Ṭabaqāt al-atibbāʾ waʾl-falāsifa,* ed. Ayman Fuʾād
    Sayyid, 2^nd^ ed. (Beirut, Muʾassasat al-Risāla, 1985) 88-91.

[^37]: Ibn Juljul, *Ṭabaqāt al-atibbāʾ waʾl-falāsifa*, also relates the
    story of how Ibn al-Jazzār politely returned al-Qāḍī al-Nuʿmān's
    gift of money and a robe for treating his son. The same story is
    quoted in Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, *ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ,* 481.

[^38]: *Banū ʿUbayd* or *al-dawla al-ʿUbaydiyya* is a derogatory
    appellation for the Fāṭimids, derived from ʿUbayd Allāh (Little ʿAbd
    Allāh), a diminutive form of ʿAbd Allāh, the name of the founder of
    the Fāṭimid dynasty ʿAbd Allāh al-Mahdī bi-llāh (r.
    297-323/910-934).

[^39]: Both of the sources happen to be written for anti-Fāṭimid
    patrons. Ibn Juljul was a personal physician of the rival, albeit
    powerless, Umayyad caliph Hishām II (r. 366-403/976-1013), while the
    Damascene Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa wrote his valuable biographical
    dictionary of physicians for his Ayyūbid patron ʿIzz al-Dīn Aybak
    (d. (a mamlūk of al-Malik al-Muʿaẓẓam). For Ibn Juljul, see
    Marie-Geneviève Guesdon, "Les Ṭabaqāt al-Aṭṭibāʾ wa l-Ḥukamāʾ d'Ibn
    Ǧulǧul: Une Condamnation de Regime ʿĀmiride," in *Cahiers
    d'Onomastique Arabe 188-1992* (Paris: CNRS Editions, 1993), 49-59.

[^40]: Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, *ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ fī ṭabaqāt al-aṭibbāʾ,* 481.
    See also al-Mālikī's note on the custom of seasonal pilgrimage to
    the Mediterreananean coast, *Riyāḍ,* 2:403.

[^41]: This reminds us of the modern case of "voluntourism", and the
    tension between the volunteering and the touristic element of the
    activity. Similar questions may be raised, for instance, about the
    annual pilgrimage to Mecca (*ḥajj*), and whether every Muslim who
    has undertaken it has done so for purely religious reasons. To put
    it differently, can the sacred be separated from the profane
    touristic curiosity, or from the appeal of the prestige and social
    capital associated with the *ḥajj* at all?

[^42]: al-Mālikī, *Riyāḍ,* 477.

[^43]: The Fāṭimid did in fact turn some *ribāṭ*s to *dār al-ṣināʿa --*
    ship building facilities, but also built *ribāṭ*s. It is very
    plausible that they disliked the *murābiṭūn* and their practices. We
    find an expression of this distaste in the description of the
    *ribāṭ*s of Sicily by Ibn Ḥawqal. See Aslisho Qurboniev, "Traditions
    of Learning in Fāṭimid Ifrīqiya (296-362/909-973): Networks,
    Practices, and Institutions", PhD Diss. (University of Cambridge,

    certificate of audition written by his teacher for al-Mālikī exists
    in the manuscript collection of Raqqāda Museum. Idem., *al-Maktaba
    al-ʿatīqa*, 314.

[^59]: The rebellion, which lasted several years (331-335/943-947) with
    the rebels taking over much of the Fatimid territory including
    Qayrawān, was almost successful. Two of these ascetics, Rabīʿ
    al-Qaṭṭān and Mamsī, fell in the battle in the same year (334/945).
    The other two, al-Sibāʾī (d. 356/967) and Ibn Naṣrūn (d. 340/951)
    survived and apparently both died in Qayrawān. Muranyi, *Beitraige*,
    299 (Arabic tr. 313-14); Al-Mālikī, *Riyāḍ,* 2:469-506.

[^60]: On the pragmatic aspects of polemical discourses, see Luke
    Yarbrough, *Friends of the amir*, where he traces the evolution of
    discourse against non-Muslim state officials across the centuries.
    As Yarbrough shows, this type of polemics was by no means used
    against non-Muslims only. See, for instance, *Friends of the amir,*
    164ff.

[^61]: For an example of *munāẓarāt* in this context, see Aslisho
    Qurboniev "The Writing of *Munāẓarāt* in Times of Turmoil:
    Disputations in Fatimid Ifrīqiya," in *The Medieval Globe 5.2.

    for a broader appraisal of the culture of disputation in Fāṭimid
    Ifrīqiya.

[^62]: That being said, that is a similar discernible uneasiness with
    the recollection of the events by the Fāṭimid *dāʿī*s, especially by
    those who had to flee Qayrawān, like the *dāʿī* Ibn al-Haytham. See,
    Ibn al-Haytham's brief allusions in his *Kitāb al-Munāẓarāt,* ed.
    and tr. Paul Walker and Wilferd Madelung as *The Advent of the
    Fatimids.*

    Méditerranée* 40, 1 (1985): 45--53.

[^65]: It appears that the *Mukhtaliṭa* was the first draft of what was
    essentially a revised *Asadiyya.* Saḥnūn later compiled and arranged
    it and it became the *Mudawwana,* but there is a great deal of
    confusion about this process. See Najmeddine al-Hentati, "Min
    al-Asadiyya ilā al-Mukhtaliṭa f'al-Mudawwana," in *Murāsilāt
    ḥaḍāriyya ḥawla al-Qayrawān,* ed. N. Hentati (Tunis: Markaz
    al-Dirāsāt al-Islāmiyya, 2015), pp. 39-52. For a survey of modern
    studies and classical sources on Saḥnūn's life, see, Brockopp,
    "Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd (d. 240/854)", in O. Arabi et al. (eds.), *Islamic
    Legal Thought: A Compendium of Muslim Jurists* (Leiden: Brill,

    Mosque-Library of Kairouan," *ILS* 6, 3 (October 1999): 393--402,
    394. The date of the compilation of the *Mudawwana,* and whether its
    transmission was fixed during Saḥnūn's lifetime has been a subject
    of debate among scholars. While early fragments point to the
    circulation of various chapters of the work in the teaching circles
    of Qayrawān in the second half of the third/ninth century, the
    earliest witness to a complete copy of it is from mid-fifth/eleventh
    century. See Jonathan E. Brockopp, "Saḥnūn's *Mudwanna* and the
    Piety of the *Sharīʿah*-minded" in *Islamic Law in Theory: Studies
    on Jurisprudence in Honor of Bernard Weiss,* eds. Kevin Reinhart and
    Robert Gleave (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 2014), 129-41, 132-33.

[^67]: Miklos Muranyi, *Die Rechtsbücher des Qairawāners Sahnūn b.
    Saʿīd: Entstehungsgeschichte und Werküberlieferung* (Stuttgart:
    Franz Steiner, 1999); Brockopp, *Muhammad's Heirs;* idem,
    \"Contradictory Evidence," 115--32; idem, "Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd (d.
    240/854)." To this add the works of Tunisian historians, including
    Hady R. Idris, H. Mones, M. Talbi and more recently by N. Hentati
    among others.

[^68]: Brockopp, *Muhammad's Heirs,* 200. While the dating of the final
    compilation of the *Mudawwana* to the third/ninth century is a
    subject of debate, it is evident that in the Fāṭimid period the work
    received its final shape.

[^69]: Saḥnūn's student Saʿid b al-Ḥaddād reportedly criticised the
    *Mudawwana* calling it "head-spinner" (*mudawwima*), because of its
    bad organisation. See, ʿIyāḍ, *Madārik*, 352. According to Ibn Nājī
    and al-Dabbāgh, he called the book "*mudawwada"* (worm-eaten). See,
    *Maʻālim,* 2: 295. Later, the famous North African historian, Ibn
    Khaldūn also stated that the structure of Saḥnūn's book was so
    confusing that people called it "*Mudawwanah-*and-*Mukhtaliṭah* (the
    messed up, confused one)." See Ibn Khaldūn, *The Muqaddimah,* 1:15.

[^70]: Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ mentions at least three abridgements of the
    *Asadiyya,* one of them by the eminent Mālikī scholar and historian
    of Egypt, Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Ḥakam (d. 268/882). ʿIyāḍ, *Tartīb
    al-madārik wa taqrīb al-masālik li-maʿrifati aʿlām madhhab Mālik,*
    ed. ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Ṣaḥrāwī (Rabāt, al-Maṭbaʿat al-Malikiyya,
    1968), 3:299-300, for the general context of the alleged suppression
    of the *Asadiyya,* pp. 296-301.

[^71]: See, Qurboniev, "The Writing of *Munāẓarāt*."

[^72]: Abuʾl-ʿArab, *Ṭabaqāt,* 102. Here, Abuʾl-ʿArab mentions his
    compilation titled "On the Virtues \[of Saḥnūn\] and his Character
    as a Judge."

[^73]: Therefore, the term "deposits of memory" may suit our purpose
    better.

[^74]: Brockopp's portrayal of Saḥnūn as an exemplary individual with an
    appeal to diverse audiences supports my contention. Brockopp,
    \"Contradictory Evidence," 127. On a broader understanding of "sites
    of memory" to include metaphorical "sites" such as events, people
    and so on, see, Andrzej Szpociński, "Sites and Non-Sites of Memory",
    *Teksty drugie: Memory and Place* 1 (2016): 245-54, 249; Stanković,
    "Spaces of memory," 87-94. Also, compare the notion of remembering
    Qayrawān as "the city of Saḥnūn" with "Descartes c'est la France."
    See, François Azouvi, "Descartes", in Pierre Nora, *Realms of
    Memory: The Construction of the French Past, Vol. 3, Symbols* (New
    York, NY: Columbia University Press, 1998), ch. 14, 483.
